abstract = {Kinesin-1 is a dimeric motor that transports cargo along microtubules, taking 8.2-nm steps in a hand-over-hand fashion. The ATP hydrolysis cycles of its two heads are maintained out of phase by a series of gating mechanisms, which lead to processive runs averaging ∼1 $\mu$m. A key structural element for inter-head coordination is the neck linker (NL), which connects the heads to the stalk. To examine the role of the NL in regulating stepping, we investigated NL mutants of various lengths using single-molecule optical trapping and bulk fluorescence approaches in the context of a general framework for gating. Our results show that, although inter-head tension enhances motor velocity, it is crucial neither for inter-head coordination nor for rapid rear-head release. Furthermore, cysteine-light mutants do not produce wild-type motility under load. We conclude that kinesin-1 is primarily front-head gated, and that NL length is tuned to enhance unidirectional processivity and velocity.},

abstract = {The response of motor proteins to external loads underlies their ability to work in teams and determines the net speed and directionality of cargo transport. The mammalian kinesin-2, KIF3A/B, is a heterotrimeric motor involved in intraflagellar transport and vesicle motility in neurons. Bidirectional cargo transport is known to result from the opposing activities of KIF3A/B and dynein bound to the same cargo, but the load-dependent properties of kinesin-2 are poorly understood. We used a feedback-controlled optical trap to probe the velocity, run length, and unbinding kinetics of mouse KIF3A/B under various loads and nucleotide conditions. The kinesin-2 motor velocity is less sensitive than kinesin-1 to external forces, but its processivity diminishes steeply with load, and the motor was observed occasionally to slip and reattach. Each motor domain was characterized by studying homodimeric constructs, and a global fit to the data resulted in a comprehensive pathway that quantifies the principal force-dependent kinetic transitions. The properties of the KIF3A/B heterodimer are intermediate between the two homodimers, and the distinct load-dependent behavior is attributable to the properties of the motor domains and not to the neck linkers or the coiled-coil stalk. We conclude that the force-dependent movement of KIF3A/B differs significantly from conventional kinesin-1. Against opposing dynein forces, KIF3A/B motors are predicted to rapidly unbind and rebind, resulting in qualitatively different transport behavior from kinesin-1.},

abstract = {Kinesin and dynein motors transport intracellular cargos bidirectionally by pulling them in opposite directions along microtubules, through a process frequently described as a 'tug of war' 1 . While kinesin produces 6 pN of force, mammalian dynein was found to be a surprisingly weak motor (0.5–1.5 pN) in vitro, suggesting that many dyneins are required to counteract the pull of a single kinesin 2 . Mammalian dynein's association with dynactin and Bicaudal-D2 (BICD2) activates its processive motility 3–6 , but it was unknown how this affects dynein's force output. Here, we show that formation of the dynein–dynactin–BICD2 (DDB) complex increases human dynein's force production to 4.3 pN. An in vitro tug-of-war assay revealed that a single DDB successfully resists a single kinesin. Contrary to previous reports, the clustering of many dyneins is not required to win the tug of war. Our work reveals the key role of dynactin and a cargo adaptor protein in shifting the balance of forces between dynein and kinesin motors during intracellular transport. Cytoplasmic dynein ('dynein' hereafter) is a minus-end-directed microtubule motor responsible for cargo trafficking, organelle positioning, and organization of the mitotic spindle in eukaryotic cells 7 . The core of the dynein complex comprises a homodimer of two massive heavy chains, each containing a AAA+ motor ring, a microtubule-binding domain separated from the ring by a ∼15 nm coiled-coil stalk, and a flexible cargo-binding tail that also serves as the dimerization domain and the binding site for dynein light and intermediate chains 8,9},

abstract = {Cytoplasmic dynein, a member of the AAA (ATPases Associated with diverse cellular Activities) family of proteins, drives the processive movement of numerous intracellular cargos towards the minus end of microtubules. Here, we summarize the structural and motile properties of dynein and highlight features that distinguish this motor from kinesin-1 and myosin V, two well-studied transport motors. Integrating information from recent crystal and cryoelectron microscopy structures, as well as high-resolution single-molecule studies, we also discuss models for how dynein biases its movement in one direction along a microtubule track, and present a movie that illustrates these principles. The architecture and nucleotide-dependent conformational changes of the dynein motor domain were recently resolved in several recent structural studies. Dynein displays conspicuous differences from kinesin and myosin, including the independent stepping behavior of the two motor domains in the homodimer, its much weaker directional bias, and the long separation between the polymer-binding domain and the catalytic body of the enzyme. The dynein linker domain plays an important role in the mechanics of movement but also regulates specific transitions in the ATPase cycle. Dynein may use several mechanisms to bias its movement towards the minus end, including conformational changes of its linker domain, Brownian search, and an asymmetric binding mechanism of its microtubule-binding domain.},

abstract = {It is widely held that tau determines the stability of microtubules in growing axons, although direct evidence supporting this hypothesis is lacking. Previous studies have shown that the microtubule polymer in the distal axon and growth cone is the most dynamic of growing axons; it turns over more rapidly and is more sensitive to microtubule depolymerizing drugs than the polymer situated proximally. We reasoned that if the stability of axonal microtubules is directly related to their content of tau, then the polymer in the distal axon should have less tau than the polymer in the proximal axon. We tested this proposition by measuring the relative tau content of microtubule along growing axons of cultured sympathetic neurons immunostained for tau and tubulin. Our results show that the tau content of microtubules varies along the axon, but in the opposite way predicted. Specifically, the relative tau content of microtubules increases progressively along the axon to reach a peak near the growth cone that is severalfold greater than that observed proximally. Thus, tau is most enriched on the most dynamic polymer of the axon. We also show that the gradient in tau content of microtubules does not generate corresponding gradients in the extent of tubulin assembly or in the sensitivity of axonal microtubules to nocodazole. On the basis of these findings, we propose that tau in growing axons has functions other than promoting microtubule assembly and stability and the key sites for these functions are the distal axon and growth cone.},

abstract = {With every step it takes, the kinesin motor undergoes a mechanochemical reaction cycle that includes the hydrolysis of one ATP molecule, ADPP(i) release, plus an unknown number of additional transitions. Kinesin velocity depends on both the magnitude and the direction of the applied load. Using specialized apparatus, we subjected single kinesin molecules to forces in differing directions. Sideways and forward loads up to 8 pN exert only a weak effect, whereas comparable forces applied in the backward direction lead to stall. This strong directional bias suggests that the primary working stroke is closely aligned with the microtubule axis. Sideways loads slow the motor asymmetrically, but only at higher ATP levels, revealing the presence of additional, load-dependent transitions late in the cycle. Fluctuation analysis shows that the cycle contains at least four transitions, and confirms that hydrolysis remains tightly coupled to stepping. Together, our findings pose challenges for models of kinesin motion.},

abstract = {In long-range transport of cargo, prototypical kinesin-1 steps along a single protofilament on the microtubule, an astonishing behavior given the number of theoretically available binding sites on adjacent protofilaments. Using a laser trap assay, we analyzed the trajectories of several representatives from the kinesin-2 class on freely suspended microtubules. In stark contrast to kinesin-1, these motors display a wide range of left-handed spiraling around microtubules and thus generate torque during cargo transport. We provide direct evidence that kinesin's neck region determines the torque-generating properties. A model system based on kinesin-1 corroborates this result: disrupting the stability of the neck by inserting flexible peptide stretches resulted in pronounced left-handed spiraling. Mimicking neck stability by crosslinking significantly reduced the spiraling of the motor up to the point of protofilament tracking. Finally, we present a model that explains the physical basis of kinesin's spiraling around the microtubule. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc..},

abstract = {Kinesin is a molecular walking machine that organizes cells by hauling packets of components directionally along microtubules. The physical mechanism that impels directional stepping is uncertain. We show here that, under very high backward loads, the intrinsic directional bias in kinesin stepping can be reversed such that the motor walks sustainedly backwards in a previously undescribed mode of ATP-dependent backward processivity. We find that both forward and backward 8-nm steps occur on the microsecond timescale and that both occur without mechanical substeps on this timescale. The data suggest an underlying mechanism in which, once ATP has bound to the microtubule-attached head, the other head undergoes a diffusional search for its next site, the outcome of which can be biased by an applied load.},

Figure S1 Simulated steps added to bead position noise 
To test how the step finder algorithm recovers a known signal, computer generated steps were added to real noise (a), recorded from a kinesin-bead stalled under a {\~{}}7 pN load.   Several seconds of plateau data (from between kinesin steps) were extracted from traces and the mean positional offset adjusted to zero. Simulated steps were 8 nm in all cases but had substeps (A1+ A2) of 6+2 nm or 4+ 4 nm, with substep durations (D) of  0, 30, 50, 100, and 150µs. 
(b) The output of the step-finding and ensemble averaging algorithm given a 6 nm+2 nm input waveform (n=64 for all records shown). The shape of the input signal is obvious in the longer duration averaged steps. The rise-time of the ensemble-averaged step  (the time to rise from 10{\%} to 90{\%} of full amplitude) provides a faithful estimate of the input substep duration (D). 
(c) Same as (b) but with an input of 4+4 nm. In this case the step-finder does not recover the shape of the original (non-exponential) signal. The rise-time of the ensemble-averaged step relates to the substep duration, but in this case is 20 to 50{\%} slower than the input test substep.

Cytoplasmic dynein-1 performs a wide array of functions in most eukaryotes, both in interphase, in which it transports organelles, proteins, mRNAs, and viruses, and in mitosis and meiosis. Mutations in dynein or its regulators are linked to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we begin by providing a synthesis of recent data to describe the current model of dynein's mechanochemical cycle.

To determine the effects of tau on dynein and kinesin motility, we conducted single-molecule studies of motor proteins moving along tau-decorated microtubules. Dynein tended to reverse direction, whereas kinesin tended to detach at patches of bound tau. Kinesin was inhibited at about a tenth of the tau concentration that inhibited dynein, and the microtubule-binding domain of tau was sufficient to inhibit motor activity.

The load F was generated by applying a spatially uniform magnetic field gradient to a superparamagnetic bead attached to the (+) end of the microtubule. When F was scaled by the average number of motors [Symbol: see text]n[Symbol: see text], the force-velocity relationship for multiple motors was similar to the force-velocity relationship for a single motor, supporting a minimal load-sharing model. The velocity distribution at low load has a single mode consistent with rapid fluctuations of n. However, against a load of 2.5-4.7 pN/motor, additional modes appeared at lower velocity. These observations support the Klumpp-Lipowsky model of multimotor transport [Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 102. 17284-17289 (2005)].},

Outer and central fibres appear to be essentially similar in substructure and are made up of a number of longitudinal filaments which form the wall of the hollow fibres. The filaments are 40-50 {\AA} apart, centre to centre, and are beaded, the beads (or subunits) giving rise to an axial repeat along the filaments of 40 {\AA} and a basic surface lattice of 40 x 50 {\AA}. In collapsed or disintegrating fibres no other substructural features are usually visible. In intact fibres, however, additional longitudinal periodicities are apparent. An 80-{\AA} spacing is prominent, and there is commonly also a strong 160-{\AA} repeat. These appear to be orders of a fundamental 480-{\AA} period. The long spacings are thought to arise as departures in the arrangement of the subunits from the simple 40 x 50 {\AA} lattice, the perturbations probably occurring both radially and in the plane of the surface of the fibre. In the central fibres additional material is present, spaced at 160 {\AA} and probably corresponding to the central sheath previously described from sectioned material. Observations on the arms of the outer fibres are described.},

@article{Gross2004,
abstract = {Active transport is critical for cellular organization and function, and impaired transport has been linked to diseases such as neuronal degeneration. Much long distance transport in cells uses opposite polarity molecular motors of the kinesin and dynein families to move cargos along microtubules. It is increasingly clear that many cargos are moved by both sets of motors, and frequently reverse course. This review compares this bi-directional transport to the more well studied uni-directional transport. It discusses some bi-directionally moving cargos, and critically evaluates three different physical models for how such transport might occur. It then considers the evidence for the number of active motors per cargo, and how the net or average direction of transport might be controlled. The likelihood of a complex linking the activities of kinesin and dynein is also discussed. The paper concludes by reviewing elements of apparent universality between different bi-directionally moving cargos and by briefly considering possible reasons for the existence of bi-directional transport.},

abstract = {Kinesin is a homodimeric motor with two catalytic heads joined to a stalk via short neck linkers (NLs). We measured the torsional properties of single recombinant molecules by tracking the thermal angular motions of fluorescently labeled beads bound to the C terminus of the stalk. When kinesin heads were immobilized on microtubules (MTs) under varied nucleotide conditions, we observed bounded or unbounded angular diffusion, depending on whether one or both heads were attached to the MT. Free rotation implies that NLs act as swivels. From data on constrained diffusion, we conclude that the coiled-coil stalk domains are approximately 30-fold stiffer than its flexible "hinge" regions. Surprisingly, while tracking processive kinesin motion at low ATP concentrations, we observed occasional abrupt reversals in the directional orientations of the stalk. Our results impose constraints on kinesin walking models and suggest a role for rotational freedom in cargo transport.},

abstract = {Vesicles, organelles and other intracellular cargo are transported by kinesin and dynein motors, which move in opposite directions along microtubules. This bidirectional cargo movement is frequently described as a 'tug of war' between oppositely directed molecular motors attached to the same cargo. However, although many experimental and modelling studies support the tug-of-war paradigm, numerous knockout and inhibition studies in various systems have found that inhibiting one motor leads to diminished motility in both directions, which is a 'paradox of co-dependence' that challenges the paradigm. In an effort to resolve this paradox, three classes of bidirectional transport models - microtubule tethering, mechanical activation and steric disinhibition - are proposed, and a general mathematical modelling framework for bidirectional cargo transport is put forward to guide future experiments.},

abstract = {An important function of microtubules is to move cellular structures such as chromosomes, mitotic spindles and other organelles around inside cells. This is achieved by attaching the ends of microtubules to cellular structures; as the microtubules grow and shrink, the structures are pushed or pulled around the cell. How do the ends of microtubules couple to cellular structures, and how does this coupling regulate the stability and distribution of the microtubules? It is now clear that there are at least three properties of a microtubule end: it has alternate structures; it has a biochemical transition defined by GTP hydrolysis; and it forms a distinct target for the binding of specific proteins. These different properties can be unified by thinking of the microtubule as a molecular machine, which switches between growing and shrinking modes. Each mode is associated with a specific end structure on which end-binding proteins can assemble to modulate dynamics and couple the dynamic properties of microtubules to the movement of cellular structures.},

abstract = {Kinesin is a motor protein that uses the energy derived from ATP hydrolysis to transport organelles along microtubules. By analyzing the thermal fluctuation of microtubules tethered to glass surfaces by single molecules of kinesin, we have measured the torsional flexibility of the motor protein. The torsional stiffness of kinesin, (117 +/- 19) x 10(-24) N.m.rad-1 (mean +/- SEM), is so low that one kT of energy (approximately 4.1 x 10(-21) J at room temperature) is sufficient to twist a kinesin molecule through more than 360 degrees from its resting orientation. Consistent with this flexibility, motility assays show that one or more kinesin molecules can move a microtubule equally well in any direction. These results explain how a motor on the surface of an organelle can rapidly bind to and capture a microtubule irrespective of the organelle's orientation. Furthermore, the flexibility ensures that several motors can efficiently work together even though they are randomly oriented on the surface of an organelle rather than being in precise arrays like the motors of muscle and cilia.},

A kinesin molecule was adsorbed onto a latex bead, which was captured by an optical trap and brought into contact with an axoneme that was bound to a glass surface. The displacement of kinesin during force generation was determined by measuring the position of the beads with nanometer accuracy. As the displacement of kinesin was attenuated because of the compliance of the kinesin-to-bead and kinesin-to-microtubule linkages, the compliance was monitored during force generation and was used to correct the displacement of kinesin. Thus the velocity and the unitary steps could be obtained accurately over a wide force range. The force-velocity curves were linear from 0 to a maximum force at 10 microM and 1 mM ATP, and the maximum force was approximately 7 pN, which is larger by approximately 30{\%} than values previously reported. Kinesin exhibited forward and occasionally backward stepwise displacements with a size of approximately 8 nm. The histograms of step dwell time show a monotonic decrease with time. Model calculations indicate that each kinesin head steps by 16-nm, whereas kinesin molecule steps by 8-nm.},

Neuropathological phenotypes comprise Pick's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, argyrophilic grain disease, primary age-related tauopathy, formerly called also as neurofibrillary tangle-only dementia, and a recently characterized entity called globular glial tauopathy. Mutations in the gene encoding the microtubule-associated protein tau are associated with frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17. In addition, further neurodegenerative conditions with diverse aetiologies may be associated with tau pathologies. Thus, the spectrum of tau pathologies and tauopathy entities expands beyond the traditionally discussed disease forms. Detailed multidisciplinary studies are still required to understand their significance.},

Often, multiple kinesin or dynein motors move the same cargo. Their collective function depends critically on the single motors detachment kinetics under load, which we experimentally measure here. This experimental constraintcombined with other experimentally determined parametersis then incorporated into theoretical stochastic and mean-field models. Comparison of modeling results and in vitro data shows good agreement for the stochastic, but not mean-field, model. Many cargos in vivo move bidirectionally, frequently reversing course. Because both kinesin and dynein are present on the cargos, one popular hypothesis explaining the frequent reversals is that the opposite-polarity motors engage in unregulated stochastic tugs-of-war. Then, the cargos motion can be explained entirely by the outcome of these opposite-motor competitions. Here, we use fully calibrated stochastic and mean-field models to test the tug-of-war hypothesis. Neither model agrees well with our in vivo data, suggesting that, in addition to inevitable tugs-of-war between opposite motors, there is an additional level of regulation not included in the models.},

abstract = {Transport by processive molecular motors plays an important role in many cell biological phenomena. In many cases, motors work together to transport cargos in the cell, so it is important to understand the mechanics of the multiple motors. Based on earlier modeling efforts, here we study effects of nonlinear force-velocity relations and stochastic load sharing on multiple motor transport. We find that when two or three motors transport the cargo, then the nonlinear and stochastic effects compensate so that the mechanical properties of the transport are robust. Similarly, the transport is insensitive to compliance of the cargo-motor links. Furthermore, the rate of movement against moderate loads is not improved by increasing the small number of motors. When the motor number is greater than 4, correlations between the motors become negligible, and the earlier analytical mean-field theory of the multiple motor transport holds. We predict that the effective diffusion of the cargo driven by the multiple motors under load increases by an order of magnitude compared to that for the single motor. Finally, our simulations predict that the stochastic effects are responsible for a significant dispersion of velocities generated by the 'tug-of-war' of the multiple opposing motors.},

Molecular motors actively step along microtubules to shuttle cellular materials between the nucleus and the cell periphery; this transport is critical for the survival and health of all eukaryotic cells. Structural defects in microtubules exist, but whether these defects impact molecular motor-based transport remains unknown. Here, we report a new, to our knowledge, approach that allowed us to directly investigate the impact of such defects. Using a modified optical-trapping method, we examined the group function of a major molecular motor, conventional kinesin, when transporting cargos along individual microtubules. We found that microtubule defects influence kinesin-based transport in vitro. The effects depend on motor number: cargos driven by a few motors tended to unbind prematurely from the microtubule, whereas cargos driven by more motors tended to pause. To our knowledge, our study provides the first direct link between microtubule defects and kinesin function. The effects uncovered in our study may have physiological relevance in vivo.},

abstract = {Cytoskeletal molecular motors belonging to the kinesin and dynein families transport cargos (for example, messenger RNA, endosomes, virus) on polymerized linear structures called microtubules in the cell. These 'nanomachines' use energy obtained from ATP hydrolysis to generate force, and move in a step-like manner on microtubules. Dynein has a complex and fundamentally different structure from other motor families. Thus, understanding dynein's force generation can yield new insight into the architecture and function of nanomachines. Here, we use an optical trap to quantify motion of polystyrene beads driven along microtubules by single cytoplasmic dynein motors. Under no load, dynein moves predominantly with a mixture of 24-nm and 32-nm steps. When moving against load applied by an optical trap, dynein can decrease step size to 8 nm and produce force up to 1.1 pN. This correlation between step size and force production is consistent with a molecular gear mechanism. The ability to take smaller but more powerful strokes under load--that is, to shift gears--depends on the availability of ATP. We propose a model whereby the gear is downshifted through load-induced binding of ATP at secondary sites in the dynein head.},

The dynactin protein complex is important for dynein activity in vivo, but its precise role has been unclear. Here, we found that purified mammalian dynein did not move processively on microtubules in vitro. However, when dynein formed a complex with dynactin and one of four different cargo-specific adapter proteins, the motor became ultraprocessive, moving for distances similar to those of native cargoes in living cells. Thus, we propose that dynein is largely inactive in the cytoplasm and that a variety of adapter proteins activate processive motility by linking dynactin to dynein only when the motor is bound to its proper cargo.},

LIS1, NudE, and NudEL are dynein interactors initially implicated in brain developmental disease but now known to be required in cell migration, nuclear, centrosomal, and microtubule transport, mitosis, and growth cone motility. Identification of a specific role for these proteins in cytoplasmic dynein motor regulation has remained elusive. We find that NudE stably recruits LIS1 to the dynein holoenzyme molecule, where LIS1 interacts with the motor domain during the prepowerstroke state of the dynein crossbridge cycle. NudE abrogates dynein force production, whereas LIS1 alone or with NudE induces a persistent-force dynein state that improves ensemble function of multiple dyneins for transport under high-load conditions. These results likely explain the requirement for LIS1 and NudE in the transport of nuclei, centrosomes, chromosomes, and the microtubule cytoskeleton as well as the particular sensitivity of migrating neurons to reduced LIS1 expression. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Kinesin-1 is a dimeric motor protein, central to intracellular transport, that steps hand-over-hand toward the microtubule (MT) plus-end, hydrolyzing one ATP molecule per step. Its remarkable processivity is critical for ferrying cargo within the cell: over 100 successive steps are taken, on average, before dissociation from the MT. Despite considerable work, it is not understood which features coordinate, or "gate," the mechanochemical cycles of the two motor heads. Here, we show that kinesin dissociation occurs subsequent to, or concomitant with, phosphate (P(i)) release following ATP hydrolysis. In optical trapping experiments, we found that increasing the steady-state population of the posthydrolysis ADP {\textperiodcentered} P(i) state (by adding free P(i)) nearly doubled the kinesin run length, whereas reducing either the ATP binding rate or hydrolysis rate had no effect. The data suggest that, during processive movement, tethered-head binding occurs subsequent to hydrolysis, rather than immediately after ATP binding, as commonly suggested. The structural change driving motility, thought to be neck linker docking, is therefore completed only upon hydrolysis, and not ATP binding. Our results offer additional insights into gating mechanisms and suggest revisions to prevailing models of the kinesin reaction cycle.},

Understanding how motors generate force as a team is therefore fundamentally important but is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate optical trapping at single-molecule resolution inside cells to quantify force generation by motor teams driving single phagosomes. In remarkable paradox, strong kinesins fail to work collectively, whereas weak and detachment-prone dyneins team up to generate large forces that tune linearly in strength and persistence with dynein number. Based on experimental evidence, we propose that leading dyneins in a load-carrying team take short steps, whereas trailing dyneins take larger steps. Dyneins in such a team bunch close together and therefore share load better to overcome low/intermediate loads. Up against higher load, dyneins "catch bond" tenaciously to the microtubule, but kinesins detach rapidly. Dynein therefore appears uniquely adapted to work in large teams, which may explain how this motor executes bewilderingly diverse cellular processes. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

We polymerized microtubules with protofilaments that ran either parallel to the microtubule's long axis or that ran along shallow helical paths around the cylindrical surface of the microtubule. When gliding across a kinesin-coated surface, the former microtubules did not rotate. The latter microtubules, those with supertwisted protofilaments, did rotate; the pitch and handedness of the rotation accorded with the supertwist measured by electron cryo-microscopy. The results show that kinesin follows a path parallel to the protofilaments with high fidelity. This implies that the distance between consecutive kinesin-binding sites along the microtubule must be an integral multiple of 4.1 nm, the tubulin monomer spacing along the protofilament, or a multiple of 8.2 nm, the dimer spacing.},

It is unknown whether local control is possible, for example, by changes in specific cargo-associated motor behaviour to react to impediments. Here we discover that microtubule-associated lipid droplets (LDs) in COS1 cells respond to an optical trap with a remarkable enhancement in sustained force production. This effect is observed only for microtubule minus-end-moving LDs. It is specifically blocked by RNAi for the cytoplasmic dynein regulators LIS1 and NudE/L (Nde1/Ndel1), but not for the dynactin p150(Glued) subunit. It can be completely replicated using cell-free preparations of purified LDs, where duration of LD force production is more than doubled. These results identify a novel, intrinsic, cargo-associated mechanism for dynein-mediated force adaptation, which should markedly improve the ability of motor-driven cargoes to overcome subcellular obstacles.},

Yet how microtubules tolerate the vast forces exerted on them remains unknown. Here, by using a microfluidic device, we show that microtubule stiffness decreases incrementally with each cycle of bending and release. Similar to other cases of material fatigue, the concentration of mechanical stresses on pre-existing defects in the microtubule lattice is responsible for the generation of more extensive damage, which further decreases microtubule stiffness. Strikingly, damaged microtubules were able to incorporate new tubulin dimers into their lattice and recover their initial stiffness. Our findings demonstrate that microtubules are ductile materials with self-healing properties, that their dynamics does not exclusively occur at their ends, and that their lattice plasticity enables the microtubules' adaptation to mechanical stresses.},

abstract = {Control of intracellular transport is poorly understood, and functional ramifications of tubulin isoform differences between cell types are mostly unexplored. Motors' force production and detachment kinetics are critical for their group function, but how microtubule details affect these properties-if at all-are unknown. We investigated these questions using both a vesicular transport human kinesin, Kinesin-1 and also a mitotic kinesin likely optimized for group function, Kinesin-5, moving along either bovine brain or MCF7(breast cancer) microtubules. We found that kinesin-1 functioned similarly on the two sets of microtubules-in particular, its mean force production was approximately the same, though due to its previously reported decreased processivity, the mean duration of Kinesin-1 force production was slightly decreased on MCF7 MTs. In contrast, Kinesin-5's function changed dramatically on MCF7 microtubules: its average detachment force was reduced and its force-velocity curve was different. In spite of the reduced detachment force, the force-velocity alteration surprisingly improved high-load group function for Kinesin-5 on the cancer-cell microtubules, potentially contributing to functions such as spindle-mediated chromosome separation. Significant differences were previously reported for C-terminal tubulin tails in MCF7 vs bovine brain tubulin. Consistent with this difference being functionally important, elimination of the tails made transport along the two sets of microtubules similar.},

Here, we have engineered 25 $\alpha$/$\beta$-tubulin heterodimers with distinct CTTs and PTMs and tested their interactions with four different molecular motors using single-molecule assays. Our results show that tubulin isotypes and PTMs can govern motor velocity, processivity and microtubule depolymerization rates, with substantial changes conferred by even single amino acid variation. Revealing the importance and specificity of PTMs, we show that kinesin-1 motility on neuronal $\beta$-tubulin (TUBB3) is increased by polyglutamylation and that robust kinesin-2 motility requires detyrosination of $\alpha$-tubulin. Our results also show that different molecular motors recognize distinctive tubulin 'signatures', which supports the premise of the tubulin-code hypothesis.},

Tau inhibits kinesin-dependent transport of peroxisomes, neurofilaments, and Golgi-derived vesicles into neurites. Loss of peroxisomes makes cells vulnerable to oxidative stress and leads to degeneration. In particular, tau inhibits transport of amyloid precursor protein (APP) into axons and dendrites, causing its accumulation in the cell body. APP tagged with yellow fluorescent protein and transfected by adenovirus associates with vesicles moving rapidly forward in the axon (approximately 80{\%}) and slowly back (approximately 20{\%}). Both movements are strongly inhibited by cotransfection with fluorescently tagged tau (cyan fluorescent protein-tau) as seen by two-color confocal microscopy. The data suggests a linkage between tau and APP trafficking, which may be significant in Alzheimer's disease.},

abstract = {Axoplasm from the squid giant axon contains a soluble protein translocator that induces movement of microtubules on glass, latex beads on microtubules, and axoplasmic organelles on microtubules. We now report the partial purification of a protein from squid giant axons and optic lobes that induces these microtubule-based movements and show that there is a homologous protein in bovine brain. The purification of the translocator protein depended primarily on its unusual property of forming a high affinity complex with microtubules in the presence of a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, adenylyl imidodiphosphate. The protein, once released from microtubules with ATP, migrates on gel filtration columns with an apparent molecular weight of 600 kilodaltons and contains 110-120 and 60-70 kilodalton polypeptides. This protein is distinct in molecular weight and enzymatic behavior from myosin or dynein, which suggests that it belongs to a novel class of force-generating molecules, for which we propose the name kinesin.},

abstract = {Long-distance transport in eukaryotic cells is driven by molecular motors that move along microtubule tracks. Molecular motors of the kinesin superfamily contain a kinesin motor domain attached to family-specific sequences for cargo binding, regulation, and oligomerization. The biochemical and biophysical properties of the kinesin motor domain have been widely studied, yet little is known about how kinesin motors work in the complex cellular environment. We discuss recent studies on the three major families involved in intracellular transport (kinesin-1, kinesin-2, and kinesin-3) that have begun to bridge the gap in knowledge between the in vitro and in vivo behaviors of kinesin motors. These studies have increased our understanding of how kinesin subunits assemble to produce a functional motor, how kinesin motors are affected by biochemical cues and obstacles present on cellular microtubules, and how multiple motors on a cargo surface can work collectively for increased force production and travel distance.},

abstract = {Motor-based intracellular transport and its regulation are crucial to the functioning of a cell. Disruption of transport is linked to Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases. However, many fundamental aspects of transport are poorly understood. An important issue is how cells achieve and regulate efficient long-distance transport. Mounting evidence suggests that many in vivo cargoes are transported along microtubules by more than one motor, but we do not know how multiple motors work together or can be regulated. Here we first show that multiple kinesin motors, working in conjunction, can achieve very long distance transport and apply significantly larger forces without the need of additional factors. We then demonstrate in vitro that the important microtubule-associated protein, tau, regulates the number of engaged kinesin motors per cargo via its local concentration on microtubules. This function of tau provides a previously unappreciated mechanism to regulate transport. By reducing motor reattachment rates, tau affects cargo travel distance, motive force, and cargo dispersal. We also show that different isoforms of tau, at concentrations similar to those in cells, have dramatically different potency. These results provide a well defined mechanism for how altered tau isoform levels could impair transport and thereby lead to neurodegeneration without the need of any other pathway.},
annote = {SI Figure 6
Fig. 6. Schematic illustrating the effect of increasing incubation concentration on kinesin density on beads. Beads incubated with low amounts of kinesin have only one motor attached to their surface (a). As the incubation concentration increases, the spacing between attached motors decreases (b-d). Consequently, the probability that a motor bound to a microtubule (MT) will have no neighbors that could reach the MT decreases. Note also that at high motor densities on beads, several such neighboring motors may be able to reach the MT, which is likely to increase the observed motor on-rate.

Fig. 7. Force traces corresponding to one (a) and those we attribute to two (b) motor stalling events are shown. As beads are incubated with increased kinesin concentrations, the rate of binding events goes up, so that eventually such events are no longer always cleanly separated from each other. Thus, perhaps counterintuitively, obtaining clean stall force records is more challenging at high incubation concentrations.

Microtubule bound fractions of 4RL (lane I) and 3RS (lane II) tau are compared with reference dilutions of 4RL (lane III) and 3RS (lane IV) tau. In all cases, the starting amount of tau in an assay was the same (1.4 mM). In the cosedimentation assays, the ratio of total tau to tubulin dimers was 0.072, substantially below the binding saturation turnover. Approximately 90{\%} of the 4R tau, and 87{\%} of 3R tau was found to be competent to bind microtubules as determined by quantitative densitometry analysis, confirming the tight binding of both isoforms of tau to MTs. In accordance with previous results (1), the 4RL isoform attaches slightly more readily in our assay conditions. Therefore the stronger effect of 3RS tau upon kinesin-based transport reported in this work is not due to more 3RS tau attaching to the MTs under identical incubation conditions.

Movie 1. The movie starts with a bead being held in an optical trap. Once it starts to move processively, the trap is turned off, allowing the bead to move for a short distance. The bead detaches after »1.6 mm of travel. This type of motion is typical for beads incubated with low kinesin concentrations.








SI Movie 2
Movie 2. The movie shows a bead being deposited on the microtubule and moving processively across the entire field of view. This type of motion is characteristic of {\~{}}2 motor assay (as well as assays with higher motor concentrations). The robustness of transport we observe in our {\~{}}2 motor assay may appear surprising in light of the existing theoretical predictions (1). However, in our {\~{}}2 motor assay, we do observe some activity consistent with a contribution from a third motor. Such events would correspond to three motor case of ref. 1, and one would expect increased persistence for those cases. Additionally, we stabilize the beads near a microtubule to enable them to bind before releasing the beads and measuring their persistence. This may allow several motors to be bound at the outset of motion. Such initial conditions can be expected to suppress short travel events, improving apparent transport robustness. Lastly, the kinesin binding and rebinding constants may be different from those used in ref. 1.

SI Text
Nomenclature for the number of motors moving beads.
There has been theoretical work investigating how multiple motors are expected to function together (1). Unfortunately, comparing theory and experiment is not straightforward. In the theoretical work (1), the cargo was assumed to be driven by a single group of motors, attached to the cargo at a single point. Thus, assays were classified based on the maximum number of motors participating in transport, a scheme which is optimal when cargoes have a fixed number of motors geometrically available for active transport. This constraint is not valid for our assays (see below) and so the scheme in ref. 1 is inconvenient for us.
At low kinesin concentrations, motors on the bead are so sparse, that any time the bead is moved, only one motor is able to reach the microtubule. However, as the kinesin concentration increases, there is an increasing probability that some of the time the bead will be moved by two motors located close enough to each other to work together. However, the fraction of time that this is true is a function of the kinesin concentration: at lower concentrations, on a given bead there are likely many individual active kinesins that could move the bead, but only a few of those are close enough to a second motor that the two motors could engage simultaneously. Thus if the actively transported bead happens to be moved by one of the isolated motors, it would be a "one motor bead," otherwise it would be a "two motor bead" (or perhaps "three motor bead", etc.). This illustrates the main problem with using the notation in ref. 1 for our assay classification: the number of motors geometrically available for active transport can vary from bead to bead and even for a given bead, depending on when the measurement is made. Because of this difficulty, we have chosen a convention where we characterize the population statistically, as described in the main text. Therefore, due to the differences in the experiments versus theory, our shorthand assay designations (1,{\~{}}2,3+ motor assays) are different from the designations in ref. 1.
The effective "on-rate" depends on kinesin concentration.
We expect the on-rate to be a function of the density of kinesins on the bead. Consider for instance a situation where one kinesin motor is bound to the microtubule. It is possible that there are several other motors that are close enough to the bound motor to reach the microtubule, yet are far enough from each other that they cannot be active simultaneously. In this situation, the effective on-rate will be several times the actual on-rate for each unattached motor, because as the bead (still tethered to the MT by one kinesin molecule) rotates, any one of the other available motors can rebind. Notice that, although the force measurements indicate that, when the bead was stalled, it was typically moved by two kinesins, the force measurements do not tell us how many different combinations of two kinesins there were that could work together. The on-rate is thus a function of the number of available motors which itself depends on motor density on the cargo.
Our experimental evidence indicates that the effective on-rate increases with motor concentration: compare the on-rate for the low-kinesin bead to that of the higher-kinesin bead (Fig. 2): the typical time between motile events (reflecting the effective on-rate) for the low-kinesin bead is roughly half that for the higher-kinesin bead. At high kinesin concentrations (typical of the {\~{}}2 motor assay), the bead is almost always in motion, so the on-rate is harder to estimate but is obviously higher still. Ultimately, variations in local motor arrangement for a given bead and across the bead population in a given assay, combined with the fact that the effective on-rate is not constant across assays, but increases with motor concentration, makes quantitative comparison between the previously published theory and our experiments difficult.

abstract = {We recently proposed that regulating the single-to-multiple motor transition was a likely strategy for regulating kinesin-based transport in vivo. In this study, we use an in vitro bead assay coupled with an optical trap to investigate how this proposed regulatory mechanism affects dynein-based transport. We show that tau's regulation of kinesin function can proceed without interfering with dynein-based transport. Surprisingly, at extremely high tau levels--where kinesin cannot bind microtubules (MTs)--dynein can still contact MTs. The difference between tau's effects on kinesin- and dynein-based motility suggests that tau can be used to tune relative amounts of plus-end and minus-end-directed transport. As in the case of kinesin, we find that the 3RS isoform of tau is a more potent inhibitor of dynein binding to MTs. We show that this isoform-specific effect is not because of steric interference of tau's projection domains but rather because of tau's interactions with the motor at the MT surface. Nonetheless, we do observe a modest steric interference effect of tau away from the MT and discuss the potential implications of this for molecular motor structure.},

abstract = {Kinesin is a two-headed, ATP-driven motor protein that moves processively along microtubules in discrete steps of 8 nm, probably by advancing each of its heads alternately in sequence. Molecular details of how the chemical energy stored in ATP is coupled to mechanical displacement remain obscure. To shed light on this question, a force clamp was constructed, based on a feedback-driven optical trap capable of maintaining constant loads on single kinesin motors. The instrument provides unprecedented resolution of molecular motion and permits mechanochemical studies under controlled external loads. Analysis of records of kinesin motion under variable ATP concentrations and loads revealed several new features. First, kinesin stepping appears to be tightly coupled to ATP hydrolysis over a wide range of forces, with a single hydrolysis per 8-nm mechanical advance. Second, the kinesin stall force depends on the ATP concentration. Third, increased loads reduce the maximum velocity as expected, but also raise the apparent Michaelis-Menten constant. The kinesin cycle therefore contains at least one load-dependent transition affecting the rate at which ATP molecules bind and subsequently commit to hydrolysis. It is likely that at least one other load-dependent rate exists, affecting turnover number. Together, these findings will necessitate revisions to our understanding of how kinesin motors function.},

abstract = {Lipid droplets are the intracellular sites for neutral lipid storage. They are critical for lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis, and their dysfunction has been linked to many diseases. Accumulating evidence suggests that the roles lipid droplets play in biology are significantly broader than previously anticipated. Lipid droplets are the source of molecules important in the nucleus: they can sequester transcription factors and chromatin components and generate the lipid ligands for certain nuclear receptors. Lipid droplets have also emerged as important nodes for fatty acid trafficking, both inside the cell and between cells. In immunity, new roles for droplets, not directly linked to lipid metabolism, have been uncovered, with evidence that they act as assembly platforms for specific viruses and as reservoirs for proteins that fight intracellular pathogens. Until recently, knowledge about droplets in the nervous system has been minimal, but now there are multiple links between lipid droplets and neurodegeneration: many candidate genes for hereditary spastic paraplegia also have central roles in lipid-droplet formation and maintenance, and mitochondrial dysfunction in neurons can lead to transient accumulation of lipid droplets in neighboring glial cells, an event that may, in turn, contribute to neuronal damage. As the cell biology and biochemistry of lipid droplets become increasingly well understood, the next few years should yield many new mechanistic insights into these novel functions of lipid droplets.},

abstract = {For glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), insulin granules have to be localized close to the plasma membrane. The role of microtubule-dependent transport in granule positioning and GSIS has been debated. Here, we report that microtubules, counterintuitively, restrict granule availability for secretion. In $\beta$ cells, microtubules originate at the Golgi and form a dense non-radial meshwork. Non-directional transport along these microtubules limits granule dwelling at the cell periphery, restricting granule availability for secretion. High glucose destabilizes microtubules, decreasing their density; such local microtubule depolymerization is necessary for GSIS, likely because granule withdrawal from the cell periphery becomes inefficient. Consistently, microtubule depolymerization by nocodazole blocks granule withdrawal, increases their concentration at exocytic sites, and dramatically enhances GSIS in vitro and in mice. Furthermore, glucose-driven MT destabilization is balanced by new microtubule formation, which likely prevents over-secretion. Importantly, microtubule density is greater in dysfunctional $\beta$ cells of diabetic mice.},
