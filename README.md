# Master's Thesis
Geometry Matters for Cargos Navigating 3D Microtubule Intersections

This repository contains the Latex code and various other files which compile into my Master's Thesis. To construct it, I used [this template](https://github.com/lotten/uci-thesis-latex)

The thesis itself is an extended write up of the work in the paper [Cargo navigation across 3D microtubule intersections](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/3/537)
