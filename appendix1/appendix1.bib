abstract = {We have analyzed the mechanics of individual kinesin molecules by optical trapping nanometry. A kinesin molecule was adsorbed onto a latex bead, which was captured by an optical trap and brought into contact with an axoneme that was bound to a glass surface. The displacement of kinesin during force generation was determined by measuring the position of the beads with nanometer accuracy. As the displacement of kinesin was attenuated because of the compliance of the kinesin-to-bead and kinesin-to-microtubule linkages, the compliance was monitored during force generation and was used to correct the displacement of kinesin. Thus the velocity and the unitary steps could be obtained accurately over a wide force range. The force-velocity curves were linear from 0 to a maximum force at 10 microM and 1 mM ATP, and the maximum force was approximately 7 pN, which is larger by approximately 30{\%} than values previously reported. Kinesin exhibited forward and occasionally backward stepwise displacements with a size of approximately 8 nm. The histograms of step dwell time show a monotonic decrease with time. Model calculations indicate that each kinesin head steps by 16-nm, whereas kinesin molecule steps by 8-nm.},

abstract = {With their longest dimension typically being less than 100 nm, molecular motors are significantly below the optical-resolution limit. Despite substantial advances in fluorescence-based imaging methodologies, labeling with beads remains critical for optical-trapping-based investigations of molecular motors. A key experimental challenge in bead-based assays is that the number of motors on a bead is not well defined. Particularly for single-molecule investigations, the probability of single- versus multiple-motor events has not been experimentally investigated. Here, we used bead travel distance as an indicator of multiple-motor transport and determined the lower-bound probability of bead transport by two or more motors. We limited the ATP concentration to increase our detection sensitivity for multiple- versus single-kinesin transport. Surprisingly, for all but the lowest motor number examined, our measurements exceeded estimations of a previous model by ≥2-fold. To bridge this apparent gap between theory and experiment, we derived a closed-form expression for the probability of bead transport by multiple motors, and constrained the only free parameter in this model using our experimental measurements. Our data indicate that kinesin extends to ∼57 nm during bead transport, suggesting that kinesin exploits its conformational flexibility to interact with microtubules at highly curved interfaces such as those present for vesicle transport in cells. To our knowledge, our findings provide the first experimentally constrained guide for estimating the probability of multiple-motor transport in optical trapping studies. The experimental approach utilized here (limiting ATP concentration) may be generally applicable to studies in which molecular motors are labeled with cargos that are artificial or are purified from cellular extracts.},

abstract = {Many biological machines function in discrete steps, and detection of such steps can provide insight into the machines' dynamics. It is therefore crucial to develop an automated method to detect steps, and determine how its success is impaired by the significant noise usually present. A number of step detection methods have been used in previous studies, but their robustness and relative success rate have not been evaluated. Here, we compare the performance of four step detection methods on artificial benchmark data (simulating different data acquisition and stepping rates, as well as varying amounts of Gaussian noise). For each of the methods we investigate how to optimize performance both via parameter selection and via prefiltering of the data. While our analysis reveals that many of the tested methods have similar performance when optimized, we find that the method based on a chi-squared optimization procedure is simplest to optimize, and has excellent temporal resolution. Finally, we apply these step detection methods to the question of observed step sizes for cargoes moved by multiple kinesin motors in vitro. We conclude there is strong evidence for sub-8-nm steps of the cargo's center of mass in our multiple motor records.},

abstract = {Many cellular processes require large forces that are generated collectively by multiple cytoskeletal motor proteins. Understanding how motors generate force as a team is therefore fundamentally important but is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate optical trapping at single-molecule resolution inside cells to quantify force generation by motor teams driving single phagosomes. In remarkable paradox, strong kinesins fail to work collectively, whereas weak and detachment-prone dyneins team up to generate large forces that tune linearly in strength and persistence with dynein number. Based on experimental evidence, we propose that leading dyneins in a load-carrying team take short steps, whereas trailing dyneins take larger steps. Dyneins in such a team bunch close together and therefore share load better to overcome low/intermediate loads. Up against higher load, dyneins "catch bond" tenaciously to the microtubule, but kinesins detach rapidly. Dynein therefore appears uniquely adapted to work in large teams, which may explain how this motor executes bewilderingly diverse cellular processes. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Velocity decreased linearly with increasing force, and kinesin molecules moved against applied loads of up to 5–6 pN. Comparison of force-velocity curves at limiting and saturating ATP concentrations suggests that the load-dependent diminution in kinesin velocity may be due to a decrease in the net displacement per molecule of ATP hydrolyzed, not simply to a slowing of the ATP turnover rate; kinesin would therefore appear to be a loosely coupled motor.},

To illuminate the structural basis for this function, EM was used to locate submolecular domains on bovine brain kinesin. Rotary shadowed kinesin appeared rod-shaped and ∼80 nm long. One end of each molecule contained a pair of ∼10 × 9 nm globular domains, while the opposite end was fan-shaped. Monoclonal antibodies against the ∼124 kd heavy chains of kinesin decorated the globular structures, while those specific for the ∼64 kd light chains labeled the fanshaped end. Quick-freeze, deep-etch EM was used to analyze MTs polymerized from tubulin and cross-linked to latex microspheres by kinesin. Microspheres frequently attached to MTs by arm-like structures, 25-30 nm long. The MT attachment sites often appeared as one or two ∼10 nm globular buiges. Morphologically similar cross-links were observed by quick-freeze, deep-etch EM between organelles and MTs in the neuronal cytoskeleton in vivo. These collective observations suggest that bovine brain kinesin binds to MTs by globular domains that contain the heavy chains, and that the attachment sites for organelles are at the opposite, fan-shaped end of kinesin, where the light chains are located. {\textcopyright} 1989.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Intracellular transport via processive kinesin, dynein, and myosin molecular motors plays an important role in maintaining cell structure and function. In many cases, cargoes move distances longer than expected for single motors; there is significant evidence that this increased travel is in part due to multiple motors working together to move the cargoes. Although we understand single motors experimentally and theoretically, our understanding of multiple motors working together is less developed. RESULTS We theoretically investigate how multiple kinesin motors function. Our model includes stochastic fluctuations of each motor as it proceeds through its enzymatic cycle. Motors dynamically influence each other and function in the presence of thermal noise and viscosity. We test the theory via comparison with the experimentally observed distribution of step sizes for two motors moving a cargo, and by predicting slightly subadditive stalling force for two motors relative to one. In the presence of load, our predictions for travel distances and mean velocities are different from the steady-state model: with high motor-motor coupling, we predict a form of strain-gating, where—because of the underlying motor's dynamics—the motors share load unevenly, leading to increased mean travel distance of the multiple-motor system under load. Surprisingly, we predict that in the presence of small load, two-motor cargoes move slightly slower than do single-motor cargoes. Unpublished data from G.T. Shubeita, B.C. Carter, and S.P.G. confirm this prediction in vivo. CONCLUSIONS When only a few motors are active, fluctuations and unequal load sharing between motors can result in significant alterations of ensemble function.},

We have carried out gliding assays in which 3-7 Drosophila kinesin-1 motors moved a microtubule at 200-700 $\mu$m/s against a 0-31 pN load at saturating [ATP]. The load F was generated by applying a spatially uniform magnetic field gradient to a superparamagnetic bead attached to the (+) end of the microtubule. When F was scaled by the average number of motors [Symbol: see text]n[Symbol: see text], the force-velocity relationship for multiple motors was similar to the force-velocity relationship for a single motor, supporting a minimal load-sharing model. The velocity distribution at low load has a single mode consistent with rapid fluctuations of n. However, against a load of 2.5-4.7 pN/motor, additional modes appeared at lower velocity.

abstract = {Radiation forces allow the remote manipulation of physical objects. Two radiation force-based systems have been used, in particular: 1) laser trapping, which uses a strongly convergent beam to form a micrometer-sized focal point in which particles can be trapped and manipulated in three dimensions, and 2) laser guidance, which uses a weakly convergent beam to achieve radial confinement of particles about the beam axis coupled with pushing along the beam axis, which allows the high precision delivery of particles over hundreds of micrometers. Biological applications of laser trapping include high- precision molecular motor force measurement, and those of laser guidance include the direct writing of living cells in two and three dimensions for tissue engineering applications. The results presented here show that a general electromagnetic theory, the Generalized Lorenz-Mie Theory, is able to accurately predict experimental results for both schemes without any assumptions regarding the size of the particle relative to the wavelength of the radiation. In addition, radial forces are found to be directly correlated to the dimensionless particle size (a/w) where the particle radius (a) is normalized over the beam radius (w). The dimensionless particle size can be used to theoretically estimate radiation forces in any arbitrary setup, and facilitate the design of radiation force-based systems for a variety of applications in biology and medicine.},

Periodicities revealed in the micrographs have been analysed by studying the optical diffraction patterns obtained from them. Outer and central fibres appear to be essentially similar in substructure and are made up of a number of longitudinal filaments which form the wall of the hollow fibres. The filaments are 40-50 {\AA} apart, centre to centre, and are beaded, the beads (or subunits) giving rise to an axial repeat along the filaments of 40 {\AA} and a basic surface lattice of 40 x 50 {\AA}. In collapsed or disintegrating fibres no other substructural features are usually visible. In intact fibres, however, additional longitudinal periodicities are apparent. An 80-{\AA} spacing is prominent, and there is commonly also a strong 160-{\AA} repeat. These appear to be orders of a fundamental 480-{\AA} period. The long spacings are thought to arise as departures in the arrangement of the subunits from the simple 40 x 50 {\AA} lattice, the perturbations probably occurring both radially and in the plane of the surface of the fibre. In the central fibres additional material is present, spaced at 160 {\AA} and probably corresponding to the central sheath previously described from sectioned material.

This tight regulation is essential since slowing or stoppage of transport can cause accumulation of obstacles and has been linked to diseases. Understanding the mechanisms by which transport is regulated as well as how motor proteins overcome obstacles can give important clues as to how these mechanisms break down in disease states. Here, we describe that the cytoskeleton architecture impacts transport in a vesicle-size dependent manner, leading to pausing of vesicles larger than the separation of the microtubules. We further develop methods capable of following 3D transport processes in living cells. Using these methods, we show that vesicles move using two different modes along the microtubule. Off-axis motion, which leads to repositioning of the vesicle in 3D along the microtubule correlates with the presence of steric obstacles and may help in circumventing them.},

We show here that, under very high backward loads, the intrinsic directional bias in kinesin stepping can be reversed such that the motor walks sustainedly backwards in a previously undescribed mode of ATP-dependent backward processivity. We find that both forward and backward 8-nm steps occur on the microsecond timescale and that both occur without mechanical substeps on this timescale. The data suggest an underlying mechanism in which, once ATP has bound to the microtubule-attached head, the other head undergoes a diffusional search for its next site, the outcome of which can be biased by an applied load.},

Figure S1 Simulated steps added to bead position noise 
To test how the step finder algorithm recovers a known signal, computer generated steps were added to real noise (a), recorded from a kinesin-bead stalled under a {\~{}}7 pN load.   Several seconds of plateau data (from between kinesin steps) were extracted from traces and the mean positional offset adjusted to zero. Simulated steps were 8 nm in all cases but had substeps (A1+ A2) of 6+2 nm or 4+ 4 nm, with substep durations (D) of  0, 30, 50, 100, and 150µs. 
(b) The output of the step-finding and ensemble averaging algorithm given a 6 nm+2 nm input waveform (n=64 for all records shown). The shape of the input signal is obvious in the longer duration averaged steps. The rise-time of the ensemble-averaged step  (the time to rise from 10{\%} to 90{\%} of full amplitude) provides a faithful estimate of the input substep duration (D). 
(c) Same as (b) but with an input of 4+4 nm. In this case the step-finder does not recover the shape of the original (non-exponential) signal. The rise-time of the ensemble-averaged step relates to the substep duration, but in this case is 20 to 50{\%} slower than the input test substep.

abstract = {Kinesin is a two-headed, ATP-driven motor protein that moves processively along microtubules in discrete steps of 8 nm, probably by advancing each of its heads alternately in sequence. Molecular details of how the chemical energy stored in ATP is coupled to mechanical displacement remain obscure. To shed light on this question, a force clamp was constructed, based on a feedback-driven optical trap capable of maintaining constant loads on single kinesin motors. The instrument provides unprecedented resolution of molecular motion and permits mechanochemical studies under controlled external loads. Analysis of records of kinesin motion under variable ATP concentrations and loads revealed several new features. First, kinesin stepping appears to be tightly coupled to ATP hydrolysis over a wide range of forces, with a single hydrolysis per 8-nm mechanical advance. Second, the kinesin stall force depends on the ATP concentration. Third, increased loads reduce the maximum velocity as expected, but also raise the apparent Michaelis-Menten constant. The kinesin cycle therefore contains at least one load-dependent transition affecting the rate at which ATP molecules bind and subsequently commit to hydrolysis. It is likely that at least one other load-dependent rate exists, affecting turnover number. Together, these findings will necessitate revisions to our understanding of how kinesin motors function.},

Kinetic rates in the cycle that depend upon load identify transitions at which structural changes, such as power strokes or diffusive motions, are likely to occur. Here we show, by modelling data obtained with a molecular force clamp, that kinesin mechanochemistry can be characterized by a mechanism in which a load-dependent isomerization follows ATP binding. This model quantitatively accounts for velocity data over a wide range of loads and ATP levels, and indicates that movement may be accomplished through two sequential 4-nm substeps.

abstract = {Transport by processive molecular motors plays an important role in many cell biological phenomena. In many cases, motors work together to transport cargos in the cell, so it is important to understand the mechanics of the multiple motors. Based on earlier modeling efforts, here we study effects of nonlinear force-velocity relations and stochastic load sharing on multiple motor transport. We find that when two or three motors transport the cargo, then the nonlinear and stochastic effects compensate so that the mechanical properties of the transport are robust. Similarly, the transport is insensitive to compliance of the cargo-motor links. Furthermore, the rate of movement against moderate loads is not improved by increasing the small number of motors. When the motor number is greater than 4, correlations between the motors become negligible, and the earlier analytical mean-field theory of the multiple motor transport holds. We predict that the effective diffusion of the cargo driven by the multiple motors under load increases by an order of magnitude compared to that for the single motor. Finally, our simulations predict that the stochastic effects are responsible for a significant dispersion of velocities generated by the 'tug-of-war' of the multiple opposing motors.},

abstract = {The spatial organization of the cell depends upon intracellular trafficking of cargos hauled along microtubules and actin filaments by the molecular motor proteins kinesin, dynein, and myosin. Although much is known about how single motors function, there is significant evidence that cargos in vivo are carried by multiple motors. While some aspects of multiple motor function have received attention, how the cargo itself--and motor organization on the cargo--affects transport has not been considered. To address this, we have developed a three-dimensional Monte Carlo simulation of motors transporting a spherical cargo, subject to thermal fluctuations that produce both rotational and translational diffusion. We found that these fluctuations could exert a load on the motor(s), significantly decreasing the mean travel distance and velocity of large cargos, especially at large viscosities. In addition, the presence of the cargo could dramatically help the motor to bind productively to the microtubule: the relatively slow translational and rotational diffusion of moderately sized cargos gave the motors ample opportunity to bind to a microtubule before the motor/cargo ensemble diffuses out of range of that microtubule. For rapidly diffusing cargos, the probability of their binding to a microtubule was high if there were nearby microtubules that they could easily reach by translational diffusion. Our simulations found that one reason why motors may be approximately 100 nm long is to improve their 'on' rates when attached to comparably sized cargos. Finally, our results suggested that to efficiently regulate the number of active motors, motors should be clustered together rather than spread randomly over the surface of the cargo. While our simulation uses the specific parameters for kinesin, these effects result from generic properties of the motors, cargos, and filaments, so they should apply to other motors as well.},

abstract = {The transport of cargo particles that are pulled by several molecular motors in a cooperative manner is studied theoretically in this article. The transport properties depend primarily on the maximal number N of motor molecules that may pull simultaneously on the cargo particle. Because each motor must unbind from the filament after a finite number of steps but can also rebind to it again, the actual number of pulling motors is not constant but varies with time between zero and N. An increase in the maximal number N leads to a strong increase of the average walking distance (or run length) of the cargo particle. If the cargo is pulled by up to N kinesin motors, for example, the walking distance is estimated to be 5(N-1)/N micrometers, which implies that seven or eight kinesin molecules are sufficient to attain an average walking distance in the centimeter range. If the cargo particle is pulled against an external load force, this force is shared between the motors, which provides a nontrivial motor-motor coupling and a generic mechanism for nonlinear force-velocity relationships. With increasing load force, the probability distribution of the instantaneous velocity is shifted toward smaller values, becomes broader, and develops several peaks. Our theory is consistent with available experimental data and makes quantitative predictions that are accessible to systematic in vitro experiments.},

abstract = {With every step it takes, the kinesin motor undergoes a mechanochemical reaction cycle that includes the hydrolysis of one ATP molecule, ADPP(i) release, plus an unknown number of additional transitions. Kinesin velocity depends on both the magnitude and the direction of the applied load. Using specialized apparatus, we subjected single kinesin molecules to forces in differing directions. Sideways and forward loads up to 8 pN exert only a weak effect, whereas comparable forces applied in the backward direction lead to stall. This strong directional bias suggests that the primary working stroke is closely aligned with the microtubule axis. Sideways loads slow the motor asymmetrically, but only at higher ATP levels, revealing the presence of additional, load-dependent transitions late in the cycle. Fluctuation analysis shows that the cycle contains at least four transitions, and confirms that hydrolysis remains tightly coupled to stepping.

Often, multiple kinesin or dynein motors move the same cargo. Their collective function depends critically on the single motors detachment kinetics under load, which we experimentally measure here. This experimental constraintcombined with other experimentally determined parametersis then incorporated into theoretical stochastic and mean-field models. Comparison of modeling results and in vitro data shows good agreement for the stochastic, but not mean-field, model. Many cargos in vivo move bidirectionally, frequently reversing course. Because both kinesin and dynein are present on the cargos, one popular hypothesis explaining the frequent reversals is that the opposite-polarity motors engage in unregulated stochastic tugs-of-war. Then, the cargos motion can be explained entirely by the outcome of these opposite-motor competitions. Here, we use fully calibrated stochastic and mean-field models to test the tug-of-war hypothesis. Neither model agrees well with our in vivo data, suggesting that, in addition to inevitable tugs-of-war between opposite motors, there is an additional level of regulation not included in the models.},

abstract = {Motor-based intracellular transport and its regulation are crucial to the functioning of a cell. Disruption of transport is linked to Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases. However, many fundamental aspects of transport are poorly understood. An important issue is how cells achieve and regulate efficient long-distance transport. Mounting evidence suggests that many in vivo cargoes are transported along microtubules by more than one motor, but we do not know how multiple motors work together or can be regulated. Here we first show that multiple kinesin motors, working in conjunction, can achieve very long distance transport and apply significantly larger forces without the need of additional factors. We then demonstrate in vitro that the important microtubule-associated protein, tau, regulates the number of engaged kinesin motors per cargo via its local concentration on microtubules. This function of tau provides a previously unappreciated mechanism to regulate transport. By reducing motor reattachment rates, tau affects cargo travel distance, motive force, and cargo dispersal. We also show that different isoforms of tau, at concentrations similar to those in cells, have dramatically different potency. These results provide a well defined mechanism for how altered tau isoform levels could impair transport and thereby lead to neurodegeneration without the need of any other pathway.},

Fig. 6. Schematic illustrating the effect of increasing incubation concentration on kinesin density on beads. Beads incubated with low amounts of kinesin have only one motor attached to their surface (a). As the incubation concentration increases, the spacing between attached motors decreases (b-d). Consequently, the probability that a motor bound to a microtubule (MT) will have no neighbors that could reach the MT decreases. Note also that at high motor densities on beads, several such neighboring motors may be able to reach the MT, which is likely to increase the observed motor on-rate.

In all cases, the starting amount of tau in an assay was the same (1.4 mM). In the cosedimentation assays, the ratio of total tau to tubulin dimers was 0.072, substantially below the binding saturation turnover. Approximately 90{\%} of the 4R tau, and 87{\%} of 3R tau was found to be competent to bind microtubules as determined by quantitative densitometry analysis, confirming the tight binding of both isoforms of tau to MTs. In accordance with previous results (1), the 4RL isoform attaches slightly more readily in our assay conditions. Therefore the stronger effect of 3RS tau upon kinesin-based transport reported in this work is not due to more 3RS tau attaching to the MTs under identical incubation conditions.

However, in our {\~{}}2 motor assay, we do observe some activity consistent with a contribution from a third motor. Such events would correspond to three motor case of ref. 1, and one would expect increased persistence for those cases. Additionally, we stabilize the beads near a microtubule to enable them to bind before releasing the beads and measuring their persistence. This may allow several motors to be bound at the outset of motion. Such initial conditions can be expected to suppress short travel events, improving apparent transport robustness. Lastly, the kinesin binding and rebinding constants may be different from those used in ref. 1.

SI Text
Nomenclature for the number of motors moving beads.
There has been theoretical work investigating how multiple motors are expected to function together (1). Unfortunately, comparing theory and experiment is not straightforward. In the theoretical work (1), the cargo was assumed to be driven by a single group of motors, attached to the cargo at a single point. Thus, assays were classified based on the maximum number of motors participating in transport, a scheme which is optimal when cargoes have a fixed number of motors geometrically available for active transport. This constraint is not valid for our assays (see below) and so the scheme in ref. 1 is inconvenient for us.
At low kinesin concentrations, motors on the bead are so sparse, that any time the bead is moved, only one motor is able to reach the microtubule. However, as the kinesin concentration increases, there is an increasing probability that some of the time the bead will be moved by two motors located close enough to each other to work together. However, the fraction of time that this is true is a function of the kinesin concentration: at lower concentrations, on a given bead there are likely many individual active kinesins that could move the bead, but only a few of those are close enough to a second motor that the two motors could engage simultaneously. Thus if the actively transported bead happens to be moved by one of the isolated motors, it would be a "one motor bead," otherwise it would be a "two motor bead" (or perhaps "three motor bead", etc.). This illustrates the main problem with using the notation in ref. 1 for our assay classification: the number of motors geometrically available for active transport can vary from bead to bead and even for a given bead, depending on when the measurement is made. Because of this difficulty, we have chosen a convention where we characterize the population statistically, as described in the main text. Therefore, due to the differences in the experiments versus theory, our shorthand assay designations (1,{\~{}}2,3+ motor assays) are different from the designations in ref. 1.
The effective "on-rate" depends on kinesin concentration.
We expect the on-rate to be a function of the density of kinesins on the bead. Consider for instance a situation where one kinesin motor is bound to the microtubule. It is possible that there are several other motors that are close enough to the bound motor to reach the microtubule, yet are far enough from each other that they cannot be active simultaneously. In this situation, the effective on-rate will be several times the actual on-rate for each unattached motor, because as the bead (still tethered to the MT by one kinesin molecule) rotates, any one of the other available motors can rebind. Notice that, although the force measurements indicate that, when the bead was stalled, it was typically moved by two kinesins, the force measurements do not tell us how many different combinations of two kinesins there were that could work together. The on-rate is thus a function of the number of available motors which itself depends on motor density on the cargo.
Our experimental evidence indicates that the effective on-rate increases with motor concentration: compare the on-rate for the low-kinesin bead to that of the higher-kinesin bead (Fig. 2): the typical time between motile events (reflecting the effective on-rate) for the low-kinesin bead is roughly half that for the higher-kinesin bead. At high kinesin concentrations (typical of the {\~{}}2 motor assay), the bead is almost always in motion, so the on-rate is harder to estimate but is obviously higher still. Ultimately, variations in local motor arrangement for a given bead and across the bead population in a given assay, combined with the fact that the effective on-rate is not constant across assays, but increases with motor concentration, makes quantitative comparison between the previously published theory and our experiments difficult.

abstract = {Kinesin-1 is a dimeric motor protein, central to intracellular transport, that steps hand-over-hand toward the microtubule (MT) plus-end, hydrolyzing one ATP molecule per step. Its remarkable processivity is critical for ferrying cargo within the cell: over 100 successive steps are taken, on average, before dissociation from the MT. Despite considerable work, it is not understood which features coordinate, or "gate," the mechanochemical cycles of the two motor heads. Here, we show that kinesin dissociation occurs subsequent to, or concomitant with, phosphate (P(i)) release following ATP hydrolysis. In optical trapping experiments, we found that increasing the steady-state population of the posthydrolysis ADP {\textperiodcentered} P(i) state (by adding free P(i)) nearly doubled the kinesin run length, whereas reducing either the ATP binding rate or hydrolysis rate had no effect. The data suggest that, during processive movement, tethered-head binding occurs subsequent to hydrolysis, rather than immediately after ATP binding, as commonly suggested. The structural change driving motility, thought to be neck linker docking, is therefore completed only upon hydrolysis, and not ATP binding. Our results offer additional insights into gating mechanisms and suggest revisions to prevailing models of the kinesin reaction cycle.},

abstract = {In eukaryotic cells, nanotubes represent a substantial fraction of transport intermediates between organelles. They are extracted from membranes by molecular motors walking along microtubules. We previously showed that kinesins fixed on giant unilamellar vesicles in contact with microtubules are sufficient to form nanotubes in vitro. Motors were attached to the membrane through beads, thus facilitating cooperative effects. Koster et al. proposed that motors could dynamically cluster at the tip of tubes when they are individually attached to the membrane. We demonstrate, in a recently designed experimental system, the existence of an accumulation of motors allowing tube extraction. We determine the motor density along a tube by using fluorescence intensity measurements. We also perform a theoretical analysis describing the dynamics of motors and tube growth. The only adjustable parameter is the motor binding rate onto microtubules, which we measure to be 4.7 +/- 2.4 s(-1). In addition, we quantitatively determine, for a given membrane tension, the existence of a threshold in motor density on the vesicle above which nanotubes can be formed. We find that the number of motors pulling a tube can range from four at threshold to a few tens away from it. The threshold in motor density (or in membrane tension at constant motor density) could be important for the understanding of membrane traffic regulation in cells.},

@article{Yildiz2004,
abstract = {Kinesin is a processive motor that takes 8.3-nm center-of-mass steps along microtubules for each adenosine triphosphate hydrolyzed. Whether kinesin moves by a "hand-over-hand" or an "inchworm" model has been controversial. We have labeled a single head of the kinesin dimer with a Cy3 fluorophore and localized the position of the dye to within 2 nm before and after a step. We observed that single kinesin heads take steps of 17.3 +/- 3.3 nm. A kinetic analysis of the dwell times between steps shows that the 17-nm steps alternate with 0-nm steps. These results strongly support a hand-over-hand mechanism, and not an inchworm mechanism. In addition, our results suggest that kinesin is bound by both heads to the microtubule while it waits for adenosine triphosphate in between steps.},

@article{Gittes1993,
abstract = {Microtubules are long, proteinaceous filaments that perform structural functions in eukaryotic cells by defining cellular shape and serving as tracks for intracellular motor proteins. We report the first accurate measurements of the flexural rigidity of microtubules. By analyzing the thermally driven fluctuations in their shape, we estimated the mean flexural rigidity of taxol-stabilized microtubules to be 2.2 x 10(-23) Nm2 (with 6.4{\%} uncertainty) for seven unlabeled microtubules and 2.1 x 10(-23) Nm2 (with 4.7{\%} uncertainty) for eight rhodamine-labeled microtubules. These values are similar to earlier, less precise estimates of microtubule bending stiffness obtained by modeling flagellar motion. A similar analysis on seven rhodamine-phalloidin-labeled actin filaments gave a flexural rigidity of 7.3 x 10(-26) Nm2 (with 6{\%} uncertainty), consistent with previously reported results. The flexural rigidity of these microtubules corresponds to a persistence length of 5,200 microns showing that a microtubule is rigid over cellular dimensions. By contrast, the persistence length of an actin filament is only approximately 17.7 microns, perhaps explaining why actin filaments within cells are usually cross-linked into bundles. The greater flexural rigidity of a microtubule compared to an actin filament mainly derives from the former's larger cross-section. If tubulin were homogeneous and isotropic, then the microtubule's Young's modulus would be approximately 1.2 GPa, similar to Plexiglas and rigid plastics. Microtubules are expected to be almost inextensible: the compliance of cells is due primarily to filament bending or sliding between filaments rather than the stretching of the filaments themselves.},

@article{Xu2012,
abstract = {Microtubule-based molecular motors often work in small groups to transport cargos in cells. A key question in understanding transport (and its regulation in vivo) is to identify the sensitivity of multiple-motor-based motion to various single molecule properties. Whereas both single-motor travel distance and microtubule binding rate have been demonstrated to contribute to cargo travel, the role of single-motor velocity is yet to be explored. Here, we recast a previous theoretical study, and make explicit a potential contribution of velocity to cargo travel. We test this possibility experimentally, and demonstrate a strong negative correlation between single-motor velocity and cargo travel for transport driven by two motors. Our study thus discovers a previously unappreciated role of single-motor velocity in regulating multiple-motor transport.},
