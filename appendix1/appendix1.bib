abstract = {Radiation forces allow the remote manipulation of physical objects. Two radiation force-based systems have been used, in particular: 1) laser trapping, which uses a strongly convergent beam to form a micrometer-sized focal point in which particles can be trapped and manipulated in three dimensions, and 2) laser guidance, which uses a weakly convergent beam to achieve radial confinement of particles about the beam axis coupled with pushing along the beam axis, which allows the high precision delivery of particles over hundreds of micrometers. Biological applications of laser trapping include high- precision molecular motor force measurement, and those of laser guidance include the direct writing of living cells in two and three dimensions for tissue engineering applications. The results presented here show that a general electromagnetic theory, the Generalized Lorenz-Mie Theory, is able to accurately predict experimental results for both schemes without any assumptions regarding the size of the particle relative to the wavelength of the radiation. In addition, radial forces are found to be directly correlated to the dimensionless particle size (a/w) where the particle radius (a) is normalized over the beam radius (w). The dimensionless particle size can be used to theoretically estimate radiation forces in any arbitrary setup, and facilitate the design of radiation force-based systems for a variety of applications in biology and medicine.},

abstract = {Kinesin is a microtubule-activated ATPase thought to transport membrane-bounded organelles along MTs. To illuminate the structural basis for this function, EM was used to locate submolecular domains on bovine brain kinesin. Rotary shadowed kinesin appeared rod-shaped and ∼80 nm long. One end of each molecule contained a pair of ∼10 × 9 nm globular domains, while the opposite end was fan-shaped. Monoclonal antibodies against the ∼124 kd heavy chains of kinesin decorated the globular structures, while those specific for the ∼64 kd light chains labeled the fanshaped end. Quick-freeze, deep-etch EM was used to analyze MTs polymerized from tubulin and cross-linked to latex microspheres by kinesin. Microspheres frequently attached to MTs by arm-like structures, 25-30 nm long. The MT attachment sites often appeared as one or two ∼10 nm globular buiges. Morphologically similar cross-links were observed by quick-freeze, deep-etch EM between organelles and MTs in the neuronal cytoskeleton in vivo. These collective observations suggest that bovine brain kinesin binds to MTs by globular domains that contain the heavy chains, and that the attachment sites for organelles are at the opposite, fan-shaped end of kinesin, where the light chains are located. {\textcopyright} 1989.},

abstract = {The substructure of the outer and central fibres of the flagella of Trichonympha and other flagellates has been examined by electron microscopy, using negatively-stained material. Periodicities revealed in the micrographs have been analysed by studying the optical diffraction patterns obtained from them. Outer and central fibres appear to be essentially similar in substructure and are made up of a number of longitudinal filaments which form the wall of the hollow fibres. The filaments are 40-50 {\AA} apart, centre to centre, and are beaded, the beads (or subunits) giving rise to an axial repeat along the filaments of 40 {\AA} and a basic surface lattice of 40 x 50 {\AA}. In collapsed or disintegrating fibres no other substructural features are usually visible. In intact fibres, however, additional longitudinal periodicities are apparent. An 80-{\AA} spacing is prominent, and there is commonly also a strong 160-{\AA} repeat. These appear to be orders of a fundamental 480-{\AA} period. The long spacings are thought to arise as departures in the arrangement of the subunits from the simple 40 x 50 {\AA} lattice, the perturbations probably occurring both radially and in the plane of the surface of the fibre. In the central fibres additional material is present, spaced at 160 {\AA} and probably corresponding to the central sheath previously described from sectioned material. Observations on the arms of the outer fibres are described.},

abstract = {Kinesin is a dimeric motor protein that transports organelles in a stepwise manner toward the plus- end of microtubules by converting the energy of ATP hydro- lysis into mechanical work. External forces can influence the behavior of kinesin, and force-velocity curves have shown that the motor will slow down and eventually stall under opposing loads of{\~{}}5 pN. Using an in vitro motility assay in conjunction with a high-resolution optical trapping microscope, we have examined the behavior of individual kinesin molecules under two previously unexplored loading regimes: super-stall loads ({\textgreater}5 pN) and forward (plus-end directed) loads. Whereas some theories of kinesin function predict a reversal of directionality under high loads, we found that kinesin does not walk backwards under loads of up to 13 pN, probably because of an irreversible transition in the mechanical cycle. We also found that this cycle can be significantly accelerated by forward loads under a wide range of ATP concentrations. Finally, we noted an increase in kinesin's rate of dissociation from the microtubule with increasing load, which is consistent with a load dependent partitioning between two recently described kinetic pathways: a coordinated-head pathway (which leads to stepping) and an independent-head pathway (which is static).},

The physical mechanism that impels directional stepping is uncertain. We show here that, under very high backward loads, the intrinsic directional bias in kinesin stepping can be reversed such that the motor walks sustainedly backwards in a previously undescribed mode of ATP-dependent backward processivity. We find that both forward and backward 8-nm steps occur on the microsecond timescale and that both occur without mechanical substeps on this timescale. The data suggest an underlying mechanism in which, once ATP has bound to the microtubule-attached head, the other head undergoes a diffusional search for its next site, the outcome of which can be biased by an applied load.},

Kinetic rates in the cycle that depend upon load identify transitions at which structural changes, such as power strokes or diffusive motions, are likely to occur. Here we show, by modelling data obtained with a molecular force clamp, that kinesin mechanochemistry can be characterized by a mechanism in which a load-dependent isomerization follows ATP binding. This model quantitatively accounts for velocity data over a wide range of loads and ATP levels, and indicates that movement may be accomplished through two sequential 4-nm substeps. Similar considerations account for kinesin processivity, which is found to obey a load-dependent Michaelis-Menten relationship.},

@article{Klumpp2005,
abstract = {The transport of cargo particles that are pulled by several molecular motors in a cooperative manner is studied theoretically in this article. The transport properties depend primarily on the maximal number N of motor molecules that may pull simultaneously on the cargo particle. Because each motor must unbind from the filament after a finite number of steps but can also rebind to it again, the actual number of pulling motors is not constant but varies with time between zero and N. An increase in the maximal number N leads to a strong increase of the average walking distance (or run length) of the cargo particle. If the cargo is pulled by up to N kinesin motors, for example, the walking distance is estimated to be 5(N-1)/N micrometers, which implies that seven or eight kinesin molecules are sufficient to attain an average walking distance in the centimeter range. If the cargo particle is pulled against an external load force, this force is shared between the motors, which provides a nontrivial motor-motor coupling and a generic mechanism for nonlinear force-velocity relationships. With increasing load force, the probability distribution of the instantaneous velocity is shifted toward smaller values, becomes broader, and develops several peaks. Our theory is consistent with available experimental data and makes quantitative predictions that are accessible to systematic in vitro experiments.},

abstract = {Although the velocity of single kinesin motors against an opposing force F of 0-10 pN is well known, the behavior of multiple kinesin motors working to overcome a larger load is still poorly understood. We have carried out gliding assays in which 3-7 Drosophila kinesin-1 motors moved a microtubule at 200-700 $\mu$m/s against a 0-31 pN load at saturating [ATP]. The load F was generated by applying a spatially uniform magnetic field gradient to a superparamagnetic bead attached to the (+) end of the microtubule. When F was scaled by the average number of motors [Symbol: see text]n[Symbol: see text], the force-velocity relationship for multiple motors was similar to the force-velocity relationship for a single motor, supporting a minimal load-sharing model. The velocity distribution at low load has a single mode consistent with rapid fluctuations of n. However, against a load of 2.5-4.7 pN/motor, additional modes appeared at lower velocity. These observations support the Klumpp-Lipowsky model of multimotor transport [Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 102. 17284-17289 (2005)].},

abstract = {We have analyzed the mechanics of individual kinesin molecules by optical trapping nanometry. A kinesin molecule was adsorbed onto a latex bead, which was captured by an optical trap and brought into contact with an axoneme that was bound to a glass surface. The displacement of kinesin during force generation was determined by measuring the position of the beads with nanometer accuracy. As the displacement of kinesin was attenuated because of the compliance of the kinesin-to-bead and kinesin-to-microtubule linkages, the compliance was monitored during force generation and was used to correct the displacement of kinesin. Thus the velocity and the unitary steps could be obtained accurately over a wide force range. The force-velocity curves were linear from 0 to a maximum force at 10 microM and 1 mM ATP, and the maximum force was approximately 7 pN, which is larger by approximately 30{\%} than values previously reported. Kinesin exhibited forward and occasionally backward stepwise displacements with a size of approximately 8 nm. The histograms of step dwell time show a monotonic decrease with time. Model calculations indicate that each kinesin head steps by 16-nm, whereas kinesin molecule steps by 8-nm.},

We have labeled a single head of the kinesin dimer with a Cy3 fluorophore and localized the position of the dye to within 2 nm before and after a step. We observed that single kinesin heads take steps of 17.3 +/- 3.3 nm. A kinetic analysis of the dwell times between steps shows that the 17-nm steps alternate with 0-nm steps. These results strongly support a hand-over-hand mechanism, and not an inchworm mechanism. In addition, our results suggest that kinesin is bound by both heads to the microtubule while it waits for adenosine triphosphate in between steps.},

abstract = {Kinesin is a two-headed, ATP-driven motor protein that moves processively along microtubules in discrete steps of 8 nm, probably by advancing each of its heads alternately in sequence. Molecular details of how the chemical energy stored in ATP is coupled to mechanical displacement remain obscure. To shed light on this question, a force clamp was constructed, based on a feedback-driven optical trap capable of maintaining constant loads on single kinesin motors. The instrument provides unprecedented resolution of molecular motion and permits mechanochemical studies under controlled external loads. Analysis of records of kinesin motion under variable ATP concentrations and loads revealed several new features. First, kinesin stepping appears to be tightly coupled to ATP hydrolysis over a wide range of forces, with a single hydrolysis per 8-nm mechanical advance. Second, the kinesin stall force depends on the ATP concentration. Third, increased loads reduce the maximum velocity as expected, but also raise the apparent Michaelis-Menten constant. The kinesin cycle therefore contains at least one load-dependent transition affecting the rate at which ATP molecules bind and subsequently commit to hydrolysis. It is likely that at least one other load-dependent rate exists, affecting turnover number. Together, these findings will necessitate revisions to our understanding of how kinesin motors function.},

The Langevin part includes diffusive motion, the action of the pulling motors, and hydrodynamic interactions between sphere and wall. The kinetic rules for the motors include binding to and unbinding from the filament as well as active motor steps. We find that the simulated mean transport length increases exponentially with the number of bound motors, in good agreement with earlier results. The number of motors in binding range to the motor track fluctuates in time with a Poissonian distribution, both for springs and cables being used as models for the linker mechanics.

abstract = {In eukaryotic cells, nanotubes represent a substantial fraction of transport intermediates between organelles. They are extracted from membranes by molecular motors walking along microtubules. We previously showed that kinesins fixed on giant unilamellar vesicles in contact with microtubules are sufficient to form nanotubes in vitro. Motors were attached to the membrane through beads, thus facilitating cooperative effects. Koster et al. proposed that motors could dynamically cluster at the tip of tubes when they are individually attached to the membrane. We demonstrate, in a recently designed experimental system, the existence of an accumulation of motors allowing tube extraction. We determine the motor density along a tube by using fluorescence intensity measurements. We also perform a theoretical analysis describing the dynamics of motors and tube growth. The only adjustable parameter is the motor binding rate onto microtubules, which we measure to be 4.7 +/- 2.4 s(-1). In addition, we quantitatively determine, for a given membrane tension, the existence of a threshold in motor density on the vesicle above which nanotubes can be formed. We find that the number of motors pulling a tube can range from four at threshold to a few tens away from it. The threshold in motor density (or in membrane tension at constant motor density) could be important for the understanding of membrane traffic regulation in cells.},

abstract = {With their longest dimension typically being less than 100 nm, molecular motors are significantly below the optical-resolution limit. Despite substantial advances in fluorescence-based imaging methodologies, labeling with beads remains critical for optical-trapping-based investigations of molecular motors. A key experimental challenge in bead-based assays is that the number of motors on a bead is not well defined. Particularly for single-molecule investigations, the probability of single- versus multiple-motor events has not been experimentally investigated. Here, we used bead travel distance as an indicator of multiple-motor transport and determined the lower-bound probability of bead transport by two or more motors. We limited the ATP concentration to increase our detection sensitivity for multiple- versus single-kinesin transport. Surprisingly, for all but the lowest motor number examined, our measurements exceeded estimations of a previous model by ≥2-fold. To bridge this apparent gap between theory and experiment, we derived a closed-form expression for the probability of bead transport by multiple motors, and constrained the only free parameter in this model using our experimental measurements. Our data indicate that kinesin extends to ∼57 nm during bead transport, suggesting that kinesin exploits its conformational flexibility to interact with microtubules at highly curved interfaces such as those present for vesicle transport in cells. To our knowledge, our findings provide the first experimentally constrained guide for estimating the probability of multiple-motor transport in optical trapping studies. The experimental approach utilized here (limiting ATP concentration) may be generally applicable to studies in which molecular motors are labeled with cargos that are artificial or are purified from cellular extracts.},

abstract = {Motor-based intracellular transport and its regulation are crucial to the functioning of a cell. Disruption of transport is linked to Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases. However, many fundamental aspects of transport are poorly understood. An important issue is how cells achieve and regulate efficient long-distance transport. Mounting evidence suggests that many in vivo cargoes are transported along microtubules by more than one motor, but we do not know how multiple motors work together or can be regulated. Here we first show that multiple kinesin motors, working in conjunction, can achieve very long distance transport and apply significantly larger forces without the need of additional factors. We then demonstrate in vitro that the important microtubule-associated protein, tau, regulates the number of engaged kinesin motors per cargo via its local concentration on microtubules. This function of tau provides a previously unappreciated mechanism to regulate transport. By reducing motor reattachment rates, tau affects cargo travel distance, motive force, and cargo dispersal. We also show that different isoforms of tau, at concentrations similar to those in cells, have dramatically different potency. These results provide a well defined mechanism for how altered tau isoform levels could impair transport and thereby lead to neurodegeneration without the need of any other pathway.},
annote = {SI Figure 6
Fig. 6. Schematic illustrating the effect of increasing incubation concentration on kinesin density on beads. Beads incubated with low amounts of kinesin have only one motor attached to their surface (a). As the incubation concentration increases, the spacing between attached motors decreases (b-d). Consequently, the probability that a motor bound to a microtubule (MT) will have no neighbors that could reach the MT decreases. Note also that at high motor densities on beads, several such neighboring motors may be able to reach the MT, which is likely to increase the observed motor on-rate.

Fig. 7. Force traces corresponding to one (a) and those we attribute to two (b) motor stalling events are shown. As beads are incubated with increased kinesin concentrations, the rate of binding events goes up, so that eventually such events are no longer always cleanly separated from each other. Thus, perhaps counterintuitively, obtaining clean stall force records is more challenging at high incubation concentrations.

Microtubule bound fractions of 4RL (lane I) and 3RS (lane II) tau are compared with reference dilutions of 4RL (lane III) and 3RS (lane IV) tau. In all cases, the starting amount of tau in an assay was the same (1.4 mM). In the cosedimentation assays, the ratio of total tau to tubulin dimers was 0.072, substantially below the binding saturation turnover. Approximately 90{\%} of the 4R tau, and 87{\%} of 3R tau was found to be competent to bind microtubules as determined by quantitative densitometry analysis, confirming the tight binding of both isoforms of tau to MTs. In accordance with previous results (1), the 4RL isoform attaches slightly more readily in our assay conditions. Therefore the stronger effect of 3RS tau upon kinesin-based transport reported in this work is not due to more 3RS tau attaching to the MTs under identical incubation conditions.

Movie 2. The movie shows a bead being deposited on the microtubule and moving processively across the entire field of view. This type of motion is characteristic of {\~{}}2 motor assay (as well as assays with higher motor concentrations). The robustness of transport we observe in our {\~{}}2 motor assay may appear surprising in light of the existing theoretical predictions (1). However, in our {\~{}}2 motor assay, we do observe some activity consistent with a contribution from a third motor. Such events would correspond to three motor case of ref. 1, and one would expect increased persistence for those cases. Additionally, we stabilize the beads near a microtubule to enable them to bind before releasing the beads and measuring their persistence. This may allow several motors to be bound at the outset of motion. Such initial conditions can be expected to suppress short travel events, improving apparent transport robustness. Lastly, the kinesin binding and rebinding constants may be different from those used in ref. 1.

SI Text
Nomenclature for the number of motors moving beads.
There has been theoretical work investigating how multiple motors are expected to function together (1). Unfortunately, comparing theory and experiment is not straightforward. In the theoretical work (1), the cargo was assumed to be driven by a single group of motors, attached to the cargo at a single point. Thus, assays were classified based on the maximum number of motors participating in transport, a scheme which is optimal when cargoes have a fixed number of motors geometrically available for active transport. This constraint is not valid for our assays (see below) and so the scheme in ref. 1 is inconvenient for us.
At low kinesin concentrations, motors on the bead are so sparse, that any time the bead is moved, only one motor is able to reach the microtubule. However, as the kinesin concentration increases, there is an increasing probability that some of the time the bead will be moved by two motors located close enough to each other to work together. However, the fraction of time that this is true is a function of the kinesin concentration: at lower concentrations, on a given bead there are likely many individual active kinesins that could move the bead, but only a few of those are close enough to a second motor that the two motors could engage simultaneously. Thus if the actively transported bead happens to be moved by one of the isolated motors, it would be a "one motor bead," otherwise it would be a "two motor bead" (or perhaps "three motor bead", etc.). This illustrates the main problem with using the notation in ref. 1 for our assay classification: the number of motors geometrically available for active transport can vary from bead to bead and even for a given bead, depending on when the measurement is made. Because of this difficulty, we have chosen a convention where we characterize the population statistically, as described in the main text. Therefore, due to the differences in the experiments versus theory, our shorthand assay designations (1,{\~{}}2,3+ motor assays) are different from the designations in ref. 1.
The effective "on-rate" depends on kinesin concentration.
We expect the on-rate to be a function of the density of kinesins on the bead. Consider for instance a situation where one kinesin motor is bound to the microtubule. It is possible that there are several other motors that are close enough to the bound motor to reach the microtubule, yet are far enough from each other that they cannot be active simultaneously. In this situation, the effective on-rate will be several times the actual on-rate for each unattached motor, because as the bead (still tethered to the MT by one kinesin molecule) rotates, any one of the other available motors can rebind. Notice that, although the force measurements indicate that, when the bead was stalled, it was typically moved by two kinesins, the force measurements do not tell us how many different combinations of two kinesins there were that could work together. The on-rate is thus a function of the number of available motors which itself depends on motor density on the cargo.
Our experimental evidence indicates that the effective on-rate increases with motor concentration: compare the on-rate for the low-kinesin bead to that of the higher-kinesin bead (Fig. 2): the typical time between motile events (reflecting the effective on-rate) for the low-kinesin bead is roughly half that for the higher-kinesin bead. At high kinesin concentrations (typical of the {\~{}}2 motor assay), the bead is almost always in motion, so the on-rate is harder to estimate but is obviously higher still. Ultimately, variations in local motor arrangement for a given bead and across the bead population in a given assay, combined with the fact that the effective on-rate is not constant across assays, but increases with motor concentration, makes quantitative comparison between the previously published theory and our experiments difficult.

abstract = {Kinesin-1 is a dimeric motor protein, central to intracellular transport, that steps hand-over-hand toward the microtubule (MT) plus-end, hydrolyzing one ATP molecule per step. Its remarkable processivity is critical for ferrying cargo within the cell: over 100 successive steps are taken, on average, before dissociation from the MT. Despite considerable work, it is not understood which features coordinate, or "gate," the mechanochemical cycles of the two motor heads. Here, we show that kinesin dissociation occurs subsequent to, or concomitant with, phosphate (P(i)) release following ATP hydrolysis. In optical trapping experiments, we found that increasing the steady-state population of the posthydrolysis ADP {\textperiodcentered} P(i) state (by adding free P(i)) nearly doubled the kinesin run length, whereas reducing either the ATP binding rate or hydrolysis rate had no effect. The data suggest that, during processive movement, tethered-head binding occurs subsequent to hydrolysis, rather than immediately after ATP binding, as commonly suggested. The structural change driving motility, thought to be neck linker docking, is therefore completed only upon hydrolysis, and not ATP binding. Our results offer additional insights into gating mechanisms and suggest revisions to prevailing models of the kinesin reaction cycle.},

abstract = {We analyze theoretically the effects of excluded-volume interactions between motors on the dynamics of a cargo driven by multiple motors. The model considered shares much in common with others recently proposed in the literature, with the addition of direct interaction between motors and motor back steps. The cargo is assumed to follow a continuum Langevin dynamics, while individual motors evolve following a Monte Carlo algorithm based on experimentally accessible probabilities for discrete forward and backward jumps, and attachment and detachment rates. The links between cargo and motors are considered as nonlinear springs. By means of numerical simulations we compute the relevant quantities characterizing the dynamical properties of the system, and we compare the results to those for noninteracting motors. We find that interactions lead to quite relevant changes in the force-velocity relation for cargo, with a considerable reduction of the stall force, and also cause a notable decrease of the run length. These effects are mainly due to traffic-like phenomena in the microtubule. The consideration of several parallel tracks for motors reduces such effects. However, we find that for realistic values of the number of motors and the number of tracks, the influence of interactions on the global parameters of transport of cargo are far from being negligible. Our studies also provide an analysis of the relevance of motor back steps on the modeling, and of the influence of different assumptions for the detachment rates. In particular, we discuss these two aspects in connection with the possibility of observing processive back motion of cargo at large load forces.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Intracellular transport via processive kinesin, dynein, and myosin molecular motors plays an important role in maintaining cell structure and function. In many cases, cargoes move distances longer than expected for single motors; there is significant evidence that this increased travel is in part due to multiple motors working together to move the cargoes. Although we understand single motors experimentally and theoretically, our understanding of multiple motors working together is less developed. RESULTS We theoretically investigate how multiple kinesin motors function. Our model includes stochastic fluctuations of each motor as it proceeds through its enzymatic cycle. Motors dynamically influence each other and function in the presence of thermal noise and viscosity. We test the theory via comparison with the experimentally observed distribution of step sizes for two motors moving a cargo, and by predicting slightly subadditive stalling force for two motors relative to one. In the presence of load, our predictions for travel distances and mean velocities are different from the steady-state model: with high motor-motor coupling, we predict a form of strain-gating, where—because of the underlying motor's dynamics—the motors share load unevenly, leading to increased mean travel distance of the multiple-motor system under load. Surprisingly, we predict that in the presence of small load, two-motor cargoes move slightly slower than do single-motor cargoes. Unpublished data from G.T. Shubeita, B.C. Carter, and S.P.G. confirm this prediction in vivo. CONCLUSIONS When only a few motors are active, fluctuations and unequal load sharing between motors can result in significant alterations of ensemble function.},

abstract = {Transport by processive molecular motors plays an important role in many cell biological phenomena. In many cases, motors work together to transport cargos in the cell, so it is important to understand the mechanics of the multiple motors. Based on earlier modeling efforts, here we study effects of nonlinear force-velocity relations and stochastic load sharing on multiple motor transport. We find that when two or three motors transport the cargo, then the nonlinear and stochastic effects compensate so that the mechanical properties of the transport are robust. Similarly, the transport is insensitive to compliance of the cargo-motor links. Furthermore, the rate of movement against moderate loads is not improved by increasing the small number of motors. When the motor number is greater than 4, correlations between the motors become negligible, and the earlier analytical mean-field theory of the multiple motor transport holds. We predict that the effective diffusion of the cargo driven by the multiple motors under load increases by an order of magnitude compared to that for the single motor. Finally, our simulations predict that the stochastic effects are responsible for a significant dispersion of velocities generated by the 'tug-of-war' of the multiple opposing motors.},

Often, multiple kinesin or dynein motors move the same cargo. Their collective function depends critically on the single motors detachment kinetics under load, which we experimentally measure here. This experimental constraintcombined with other experimentally determined parametersis then incorporated into theoretical stochastic and mean-field models. Comparison of modeling results and in vitro data shows good agreement for the stochastic, but not mean-field, model. Many cargos in vivo move bidirectionally, frequently reversing course. Because both kinesin and dynein are present on the cargos, one popular hypothesis explaining the frequent reversals is that the opposite-polarity motors engage in unregulated stochastic tugs-of-war. Then, the cargos motion can be explained entirely by the outcome of these opposite-motor competitions. Here, we use fully calibrated stochastic and mean-field models to test the tug-of-war hypothesis. Neither model agrees well with our in vivo data, suggesting that, in addition to inevitable tugs-of-war between opposite motors, there is an additional level of regulation not included in the models.},

abstract = {The spatial organization of the cell depends upon intracellular trafficking of cargos hauled along microtubules and actin filaments by the molecular motor proteins kinesin, dynein, and myosin. Although much is known about how single motors function, there is significant evidence that cargos in vivo are carried by multiple motors. While some aspects of multiple motor function have received attention, how the cargo itself--and motor organization on the cargo--affects transport has not been considered. To address this, we have developed a three-dimensional Monte Carlo simulation of motors transporting a spherical cargo, subject to thermal fluctuations that produce both rotational and translational diffusion. We found that these fluctuations could exert a load on the motor(s), significantly decreasing the mean travel distance and velocity of large cargos, especially at large viscosities. In addition, the presence of the cargo could dramatically help the motor to bind productively to the microtubule: the relatively slow translational and rotational diffusion of moderately sized cargos gave the motors ample opportunity to bind to a microtubule before the motor/cargo ensemble diffuses out of range of that microtubule. For rapidly diffusing cargos, the probability of their binding to a microtubule was high if there were nearby microtubules that they could easily reach by translational diffusion. Our simulations found that one reason why motors may be approximately 100 nm long is to improve their 'on' rates when attached to comparably sized cargos. Finally, our results suggested that to efficiently regulate the number of active motors, motors should be clustered together rather than spread randomly over the surface of the cargo. While our simulation uses the specific parameters for kinesin, these effects result from generic properties of the motors, cargos, and filaments, so they should apply to other motors as well.},
