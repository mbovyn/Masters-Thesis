Applying this algorithm and a convertible experimental setup we compare the performance of the two major 3D techniques based on astigmatic distortions and on multiplane detection. In both methods we obtain experimental 3D localization accuracies in agreement with theoretical predictions and characterize the depth dependence of the localization accuracy in detail.},

abstract = {The number of microtubule motors attached to vesicles, organelles, and other subcellular commodities is widely believed to influence their motile properties. There is also evidence that cells regulate intracellular transport by tuning the number and/or ratio of motor types on cargos. Yet, the number of motors responsible for cargo motion is not easily characterized, and the extent to which motor copy number affects intracellular transport remains controversial. Here, we examined the load-dependent properties of structurally defined motor assemblies composed of two kinesin-1 molecules. We found that a group of kinesins can produce forces and move with velocities beyond the abilities of single kinesin molecules. However, such capabilities are not typically harnessed by the system. Instead, two-kinesin assemblies adopt a range of microtubule-bound configurations while transporting cargos against an applied load. The binding arrangement of motors on their filament dictates how loads are distributed within the two-motor system, which in turn influences motor-microtubule affinities. Most configurations promote microtubule detachment and prevent both kinesins from contributing to force production. These results imply that cargos will tend to be carried by only a fraction of the total number of kinesins that are available for transport at any given time, and provide an alternative explanation for observations that intracellular transport depends weakly on kinesin number in vivo. ?? 2010 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {Many cargoes move bidirectionally, frequently reversing course between plus- and minus-end microtubule travel. For such cargoes, the extent and importance of interactions between the opposite-polarity motors is unknown. In this paper we test whether opposite-polarity motors on lipid droplets in Drosophila embryos are coordinated and avoid interfering with each other's activity, or whether they engage in a tug of war. To this end we impaired the minus-end transport machinery using dynein and dynactin mutations, and then investigated whether plus-end motion was improved or disrupted. We observe a surprisingly severe impairment of plus-end motion due to these alterations of minus-end motor activity. These observations are consistent with a coordination hypothesis, but cannot be easily explained with a tug of war model. Our measurements indicate that dynactin plays a crucial role in the coordination of plus- and minus-end-directed motors. Specifically, we propose that dynactin enables dynein to participate efficiently in bidirectional transport, increasing its ability to stay "on" during minus-end motion and keeping it "off" during plus-end motion.},

abstract = {Organelle transport along microtubules is believed to be mediated by organelle-associated force-generating molecules. Two classes of microtubule-based organelle motors have been identified: kinesin and cytoplasmic dynein. To correlate the mechanochemical basis of force generation with the in vivo behaviour of organelles, it is important to quantify the force needed to propel an organelle along microtubules and to determine the force generated by a single motor molecule. Measurements of force generation are possible under selected conditions in vitro, but are much more difficult using intact or reactivated cells. Here we combine a useful model system for the study of organelle transport, the giant amoeba Reticulomyxa, with a novel technique for the non-invasive manipulation of and force application to subcellular components, which is based on a gradient-force optical trap, also referred to as 'optical tweezers'. We demonstrate the feasibility of using controlled manipulation of actively translocating organelles to measure direct force. We have determined the force driving a single organelle along microtubules, allowing us to estimate the force generated by a single motor to be 2.6 x 10(-7) dynes.},

abstract = {Formin proteins, characterized by the presence of conserved formin homology (FH) domains, play important roles in cytoskeletal regulation via their abilities to nucleate actin filament formation and to interact with multiple other proteins involved in cytoskeletal regulation. The C-terminal FH2 domain of formins is key for actin filament interactions and has been implicated in playing a role in interactions with microtubules. Inverted formin 1 (INF1) is unusual among the formin family in having the conserved FH1 and FH2 domains in its N-terminal half, with its C-terminal half being composed of a unique polypeptide sequence. In this study, we have examined a potential role for INF1 in regulating microtubule structure. INF1 associates discretely with microtubules, and this association is dependent on a novel C-terminal microtubule-binding domain. INF1 expressed in fibroblast cells induced actin stress fiber formation, coalignment of microtubules with actin filaments, and the formation of bundled, acetylated microtubules. Endogenous INF1 showed an association with acetylated microtubules, and knockdown of INF1 resulted in decreased levels of acetylated microtubules. Our data suggests a role for INF1 in microtubule modification and potentially in coordinating microtubule and F-actin structure.},

The molecular mechanisms that underlie this perturbed connectivity are poorly understood, but recent studies suggest a role for axon guidance proteins. Axon guidance proteins guide growing axons during development and control structural plasticity of synaptic connections in adults. Changes in expression or function of these proteins might induce pathological changes in neural circuits that predispose to, or cause, neurological diseases. For some neurological disorders, such as midline crossing disorders, investigators have identified causative mutations in genes for axon guidance. However, for most other disorders, evidence is correlative and further studies are needed to confirm the pathological role of defects in proteins for axon guidance. Importantly, further insight into how dysregulation of axon guidance proteins causes disease will help the development of therapeutic strategies for neurological disorders.},

Mut-p53 cells were significantly resistant to the cytotoxicity of the microtubule-targeted drugs (vinca alkaloids and taxanes), as compared with wt-p53 cells. Studies by high-resolution time-lapse fluorescence microscopy in living cells indicated that the dynamics of microtubules of mut-p53 cells were altered in complex ways and were significantly increased as compared with microtubules in wt-p53 cells. The percentage of time microtubules spent in growing and shortening phases increased significantly, their catastrophe frequency increased, and their overall dynamicity increased by 33{\%}. In contrast, their shortening rate and the mean length shortened decreased. Cells containing mut-p53 displayed increased polymerisation of tubulin, increased protein levels of the class IV $\beta$-tubulin isotype, STOP and survivin, and reduced protein levels of class II $\beta$-tubulin isotype, MAP4 and FHIT. We conclude that p53 protein may contribute to the regulation of microtubule composition and function, and that alterations in p53 function may generate complex microtubule-associated mechanisms of resistance to tubulin-binding agents.},

We find that PRC1's microtubule binding is mediated by a structured domain with a spectrin-fold and an unstructured Lys/Arg-rich domain. These two domains, at each end of a homodimer, are connected by a linkage that is flexible on single microtubules, but forms well-defined crossbridges between antiparallel filaments. Further, we show that PRC1 crosslinks are compliant and do not substantially resist filament sliding by motor proteins in vitro. Together, our data show how MAP65s, by combining structural flexibility and rigidity, tune microtubule associations to establish crosslinks that selectively " mark" antiparallel overlap in dynamic cytoskeletal networks. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Kinesin-14, one of the motors involved, causes spindle collapse in the absence of kinesin-5 (Refs 2, 3), participates in spindle assembly and modulates spindle length. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these activities are not known. Here, we report that Drosophila melanogaster kinesin-14 (Ncd) alone causes sliding of anti-parallel microtubules but locks together (that is, statically crosslinks) those that are parallel. Using single molecule imaging we show that Ncd diffuses along microtubules in a tail-dependent manner and switches its orientation between sliding microtubules. Our results show that kinesin-14 causes sliding and expansion of an anti-parallel microtubule array by dynamic interactions through the motor domain on the one side and the tail domain on the other. This mechanism accounts for the roles of kinesin-14 in spindle organization.},

Here, we demonstrate microtubule nucleation from the sides of existing microtubules in meiotic Xenopus egg extracts. Daughter microtubules grow at a low branch angle and with the same polarity as mother filaments. Branching microtubule nucleation requires $\gamma$-tubulin and augmin and is stimulated by factors previously implicated in chromatin-stimulated nucleation, guanosine triphosphate(GTP)-bound Ran and its effector, TPX2. Because of the rapid amplification of microtubule numbers and the preservation of microtubule polarity, microtubule-dependent microtubule nucleation is well suited for spindle assembly and maintenance. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Although the total cellular tubulin content increases as the cells progress toward mitosis, the total tubulin/total protein ratio is stable during the cell cycle. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was applied to analyze the levels of expression of alpha, beta, and gamma-tubulin isotypes. Whereas alpha-tubulin isotype and gamma-tubulin transcripts were found to be expressed at constant levels throughout the cell cycle, some of the beta-tubulin isotype transcripts were found to be more highly expressed in dividing then in resting cells. Both of the class IV beta-tubulin isotype transcripts (human 5 beta and beta 2, Class IVa and IVb, respectively) were expressed in dividing K562 and MES-SA cells at twice the levels found in resting cells. Increased expression of the class IV isotype proteins in dividing cells was confirmed by immunoblotting, both in K562 and in MES-SA cells. A larger fraction of total cell tubulin was found to be polymerized in dividing cells (36-40{\%}) than in resting cells (27-30{\%}). The degree of polymerization of class IV tubulin in dividing and resting cells was similar to that of total tubulin. These results show that total tubulin is expressed as constant levels throughout the cell cycle but that the degree of polymerization is increased as cells are committed to division. The relative overexpression of the two class IV beta-tubulin isotypes in dividing cells suggests functional specificity for these isotypes and a regulatory role of these isotypes on the microtubule network during mitosis.},

Microtubules can intersect at a variety of angles both near the nucleus and at the cell periphery, and the behavior of molecular motors at these intersections has implications for long-range transport efficiency and accuracy. To test motor function at microtubule intersections, crossovers were arranged in vitro using flow to orient successive layers of filaments. Single kinesin and cytoplasmic dynein-dynactin molecules fused with green-fluorescent protein, and artificial bead cargos decorated with multiple motors, were observed while they encountered intersections. Single kinesins tend to cross intersecting microtubules, whereas single dynein-dynactins have a more varied response. For bead cargos, kinesin motion is independent of motor number. Dynein beads with high motor numbers pause, but their actions become more varied as the motor number decreases. These results suggest that regulating the number of active dynein molecules could change a motile cargo into one that is anchored at an intersection, consistent with dynein's proposed transport and tethering functions in the cell.},

abstract = {Intracellular transport plays an essential role in maintaining the organization of polarized cells. Motor proteins tether and move cargos along microtubules during long-range transport to deliver them to their proper location of function. To reach their destination, cargo-bound motors must overcome barriers to their forward motion such as intersection points between microtubules. The ability to visualize how motors navigate these barriers can give important information about the mechanisms that lead to efficient transport. Here, we first develop an all-optical correlative imaging method based on single-particle tracking and superresolution microscopy to map the transport trajectories of cargos to individual microtubules with high spatiotemporal resolution. We then use this method to study the behavior of lysosomes at microtubule-microtubule intersections. Our results show that the intersection poses a significant hindrance that leads to long pauses in transport only when the separation distance of the intersecting microtubules is smaller than âˆ¼100 nm. However, the obstructions are typically overcome by the motors with high fidelity by either switching to the intersecting microtubule or eventually passing through the intersection. Interestingly, there is a large tendency to maintain the polarity of motion (anterograde or retrograde) after the intersection, suggesting a high degree of regulation of motor activity to maintain transport in a given direction. These results give insights into the effect of the cytoskeletal geometry on cargo transport and have important implications for the mechanisms that cargo-bound motors use to maneuver through the obstructions set up by the complex cytoskeletal network.},

abstract = {For glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), insulin granules have to be localized close to the plasma membrane. The role of microtubule-dependent transport in granule positioning and GSIS has been debated. Here, we report that microtubules, counterintuitively, restrict granule availability for secretion. In $\beta$ cells, microtubules originate at the Golgi and form a dense non-radial meshwork. Non-directional transport along these microtubules limits granule dwelling at the cell periphery, restricting granule availability for secretion. High glucose destabilizes microtubules, decreasing their density; such local microtubule depolymerization is necessary for GSIS, likely because granule withdrawal from the cell periphery becomes inefficient. Consistently, microtubule depolymerization by nocodazole blocks granule withdrawal, increases their concentration atÂ exocytic sites, and dramatically enhances GSIS inÂ vitro and in mice. Furthermore, glucose-driven MT destabilization is balanced by new microtubule formation, which likely prevents over-secretion. Importantly, microtubule density is greater in dysfunctional $\beta$ cells of diabetic mice.},

abstract = {Motor-based intracellular transport and its regulation are crucial to the functioning of a cell. Disruption of transport is linked to Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases. However, many fundamental aspects of transport are poorly understood. An important issue is how cells achieve and regulate efficient long-distance transport. Mounting evidence suggests that many in vivo cargoes are transported along microtubules by more than one motor, but we do not know how multiple motors work together or can be regulated. Here we first show that multiple kinesin motors, working in conjunction, can achieve very long distance transport and apply significantly larger forces without the need of additional factors. We then demonstrate in vitro that the important microtubule-associated protein, tau, regulates the number of engaged kinesin motors per cargo via its local concentration on microtubules. This function of tau provides a previously unappreciated mechanism to regulate transport. By reducing motor reattachment rates, tau affects cargo travel distance, motive force, and cargo dispersal. We also show that different isoforms of tau, at concentrations similar to those in cells, have dramatically different potency. These results provide a well defined mechanism for how altered tau isoform levels could impair transport and thereby lead to neurodegeneration without the need of any other pathway.},

Beads incubated with low amounts of kinesin have only one motor attached to their surface (a). As the incubation concentration increases, the spacing between attached motors decreases (b-d). Consequently, the probability that a motor bound to a microtubule (MT) will have no neighbors that could reach the MT decreases. Note also that at high motor densities on beads, several such neighboring motors may be able to reach the MT, which is likely to increase the observed motor on-rate.

In all cases, the starting amount of tau in an assay was the same (1.4 mM). In the cosedimentation assays, the ratio of total tau to tubulin dimers was 0.072, substantially below the binding saturation turnover. Approximately 90{\%} of the 4R tau, and 87{\%} of 3R tau was found to be competent to bind microtubules as determined by quantitative densitometry analysis, confirming the tight binding of both isoforms of tau to MTs. In accordance with previous results (1), the 4RL isoform attaches slightly more readily in our assay conditions. Therefore the stronger effect of 3RS tau upon kinesin-based transport reported in this work is not due to more 3RS tau attaching to the MTs under identical incubation conditions.

The robustness of transport we observe in our {\~{}}2 motor assay may appear surprising in light of the existing theoretical predictions (1). However, in our {\~{}}2 motor assay, we do observe some activity consistent with a contribution from a third motor. Such events would correspond to three motor case of ref. 1, and one would expect increased persistence for those cases. Additionally, we stabilize the beads near a microtubule to enable them to bind before releasing the beads and measuring their persistence. This may allow several motors to be bound at the outset of motion. Such initial conditions can be expected to suppress short travel events, improving apparent transport robustness. Lastly, the kinesin binding and rebinding constants may be different from those used in ref. 1.

SI Text
Nomenclature for the number of motors moving beads.
There has been theoretical work investigating how multiple motors are expected to function together (1). Unfortunately, comparing theory and experiment is not straightforward. In the theoretical work (1), the cargo was assumed to be driven by a single group of motors, attached to the cargo at a single point. Thus, assays were classified based on the maximum number of motors participating in transport, a scheme which is optimal when cargoes have a fixed number of motors geometrically available for active transport. This constraint is not valid for our assays (see below) and so the scheme in ref. 1 is inconvenient for us.
At low kinesin concentrations, motors on the bead are so sparse, that any time the bead is moved, only one motor is able to reach the microtubule. However, as the kinesin concentration increases, there is an increasing probability that some of the time the bead will be moved by two motors located close enough to each other to work together. However, the fraction of time that this is true is a function of the kinesin concentration: at lower concentrations, on a given bead there are likely many individual active kinesins that could move the bead, but only a few of those are close enough to a second motor that the two motors could engage simultaneously. Thus if the actively transported bead happens to be moved by one of the isolated motors, it would be a "one motor bead," otherwise it would be a "two motor bead" (or perhaps "three motor bead", etc.). This illustrates the main problem with using the notation in ref. 1 for our assay classification: the number of motors geometrically available for active transport can vary from bead to bead and even for a given bead, depending on when the measurement is made. Because of this difficulty, we have chosen a convention where we characterize the population statistically, as described in the main text. Therefore, due to the differences in the experiments versus theory, our shorthand assay designations (1,{\~{}}2,3+ motor assays) are different from the designations in ref. 1.
The effective "on-rate" depends on kinesin concentration.
We expect the on-rate to be a function of the density of kinesins on the bead. Consider for instance a situation where one kinesin motor is bound to the microtubule. It is possible that there are several other motors that are close enough to the bound motor to reach the microtubule, yet are far enough from each other that they cannot be active simultaneously. In this situation, the effective on-rate will be several times the actual on-rate for each unattached motor, because as the bead (still tethered to the MT by one kinesin molecule) rotates, any one of the other available motors can rebind. Notice that, although the force measurements indicate that, when the bead was stalled, it was typically moved by two kinesins, the force measurements do not tell us how many different combinations of two kinesins there were that could work together. The on-rate is thus a function of the number of available motors which itself depends on motor density on the cargo.
Our experimental evidence indicates that the effective on-rate increases with motor concentration: compare the on-rate for the low-kinesin bead to that of the higher-kinesin bead (Fig. 2): the typical time between motile events (reflecting the effective on-rate) for the low-kinesin bead is roughly half that for the higher-kinesin bead. At high kinesin concentrations (typical of the {\~{}}2 motor assay), the bead is almost always in motion, so the on-rate is harder to estimate but is obviously higher still. Ultimately, variations in local motor arrangement for a given bead and across the bead population in a given assay, combined with the fact that the effective on-rate is not constant across assays, but increases with motor concentration, makes quantitative comparison between the previously published theory and our experiments difficult.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Intracellular transport via processive kinesin, dynein, and myosin molecular motors plays an important role in maintaining cell structure and function. In many cases, cargoes move distances longer than expected for single motors; there is significant evidence that this increased travel is in part due to multiple motors working together to move the cargoes. Although we understand single motors experimentally and theoretically, our understanding of multiple motors working together is less developed. RESULTS We theoretically investigate how multiple kinesin motors function. Our model includes stochastic fluctuations of each motor as it proceeds through its enzymatic cycle. Motors dynamically influence each other and function in the presence of thermal noise and viscosity. We test the theory via comparison with the experimentally observed distribution of step sizes for two motors moving a cargo, and by predicting slightly subadditive stalling force for two motors relative to one. In the presence of load, our predictions for travel distances and mean velocities are different from the steady-state model: with high motor-motor coupling, we predict a form of strain-gating, whereâ€”because of the underlying motor's dynamicsâ€”the motors share load unevenly, leading to increased mean travel distance of the multiple-motor system under load. Surprisingly, we predict that in the presence of small load, two-motor cargoes move slightly slower than do single-motor cargoes. Unpublished data from G.T. Shubeita, B.C. Carter, and S.P.G. confirm this prediction in vivo. CONCLUSIONS When only a few motors are active, fluctuations and unequal load sharing between motors can result in significant alterations of ensemble function.},

@article{McKenney2010,
abstract = {Cytoplasmic dynein is responsible for many aspects of cellular and subcellular movement. LIS1, NudE, and NudEL are dynein interactors initially implicated in brain developmental disease but now known to be required in cell migration, nuclear, centrosomal, and microtubule transport, mitosis, and growth cone motility. Identification of a specific role for these proteins in cytoplasmic dynein motor regulation has remained elusive. We find that NudE stably recruits LIS1 to the dynein holoenzyme molecule, where LIS1 interacts with the motor domain during the prepowerstroke state of the dynein crossbridge cycle. NudE abrogates dynein force production, whereas LIS1 alone or with NudE induces a persistent-force dynein state that improves ensemble function of multiple dyneins for transport under high-load conditions. These results likely explain the requirement for LIS1 and NudE in the transport of nuclei, centrosomes, chromosomes, and the microtubule cytoskeleton as well as the particular sensitivity of migrating neurons to reduced LIS1 expression. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Muller2008,
abstract = {Intracellular transport is based on molecular motors that pull cargos along cytoskeletal filaments. One motor species always moves in one direction, e.g., conventional kinesin moves to the microtubule plus end, whereas cytoplasmic dynein moves to the microtubule minus end. However, many cellular cargoes are observed to move bidirectionally, involving both plus- and minus-end-directed motors. The presumably simplest mechanism for such bidirectional transport is provided by a tug-of-war between the two motor species. This mechanism is studied theoretically using the load-dependent transport properties of individual motors as measured in single-molecule experiments. In contrast to previous expectations, such a tug-of-war is found to be highly cooperative and to exhibit seven different motility regimes depending on the precise values of the single motor parameters. The sensitivity of the transport process to small parameter changes can be used by the cell to regulate its cargo traffic.},

@article{Erickson2011,
abstract = {The spatial organization of the cell depends upon intracellular trafficking of cargos hauled along microtubules and actin filaments by the molecular motor proteins kinesin, dynein, and myosin. Although much is known about how single motors function, there is significant evidence that cargos in vivo are carried by multiple motors. While some aspects of multiple motor function have received attention, how the cargo itself--and motor organization on the cargo--affects transport has not been considered. To address this, we have developed a three-dimensional Monte Carlo simulation of motors transporting a spherical cargo, subject to thermal fluctuations that produce both rotational and translational diffusion. We found that these fluctuations could exert a load on the motor(s), significantly decreasing the mean travel distance and velocity of large cargos, especially at large viscosities. In addition, the presence of the cargo could dramatically help the motor to bind productively to the microtubule: the relatively slow translational and rotational diffusion of moderately sized cargos gave the motors ample opportunity to bind to a microtubule before the motor/cargo ensemble diffuses out of range of that microtubule. For rapidly diffusing cargos, the probability of their binding to a microtubule was high if there were nearby microtubules that they could easily reach by translational diffusion. Our simulations found that one reason why motors may be approximately 100 nm long is to improve their 'on' rates when attached to comparably sized cargos. Finally, our results suggested that to efficiently regulate the number of active motors, motors should be clustered together rather than spread randomly over the surface of the cargo. While our simulation uses the specific parameters for kinesin, these effects result from generic properties of the motors, cargos, and filaments, so they should apply to other motors as well.},
